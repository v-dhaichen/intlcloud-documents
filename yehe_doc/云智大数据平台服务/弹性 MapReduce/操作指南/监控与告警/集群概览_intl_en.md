Cluster overview displays a summary of cluster operation status, where you can view the cluster operation status, core service metrics, core server metrics, and top 10 loaded servers.

## Viewing Cluster Details
1. Log in to the [EMR Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/emr) and select **Cluster Monitoring** > **Cluster Overview** on the left sidebar to directly view the overall status of the current cluster.
2. The **Cluster Overview** page provides four monitoring views in the cluster dimension, namely, overall status of cluster, key cluster metrics, cluster deployment status, and top 10 loaded servers.
 - **Overall Status of Cluster** displays whether the current cluster status is normal, component quantity, server quantity, and whether metadata is online.
