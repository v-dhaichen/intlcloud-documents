## Alert for Arrears
- For pay-as-you-go EMR clusters, when your account balance is in negative, we will notify the Tencent Cloud account creator, global resource collaborators and financial collaborators via email and SMS.

## Repossession Mechanism
When your account balance falls below zero, the pay-as-you-go EMR cluster can be used and fees will be deducted for 2 more hours. After 2 hours, the cluster will be isolated and moved to the recycle bin, and we will also stop billing you for service.
- If you top up your account within 24 hours to a positive balance, the billing will continue, and the cluster will be automatically recovered.
- If your account is not topped up to a positive balance within 24 hours, the cluster cannot be recovered.
- If your account balance remains negative for 24 hours, your pay-as-you-go cluster will be terminated, and all data will be cleared and cannot be recovered.

>
- When you no longer need to use pay-as-you-go clusters, please terminate them as soon as possible to avoid further fee deductions.
- After a cluster is terminated, the data will be cleared and cannot be recovered.
- As your actual resource consumption may change over time, there may be some deviation in the balance alert.
