## Pay-as-you-go

### Arrears reminder

For pay-as-you-go resources, fees are deducted on the hour. When your account balance becomes negative, the system will notify the creator, global resource collaborators, and financial collaborators of your Tencent Cloud account via email and SMS.

### Arrears processing

You can continue to use your ES cluster for 24 hours from the moment your account balance becomes negative. The system will continue to deduct fees. 24 hours later, the ES cluster will be suspended and billing will stop.

What happens next? 

- If you top up your account to a positive balance within 7 days from the moment your account became negative (6 days after service suspension), billing resumes and you will be able to access your ES cluster.

- If your account continues to remain negative for 6 days after service suspension, your ES cluster will stay inaccessible..

If your **account stays negative for 7 days** (7x24 hours), your ES cluster will be repossessed. **All data will be deleted and cannot be recovered.**

We will notify the Tencent Cloud account creator as well as global resource and financial collaborators via email and SMS when your ES cluster is repossessed.
