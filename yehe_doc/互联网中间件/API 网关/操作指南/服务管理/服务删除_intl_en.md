## Operation Scenarios
This document describes how to delete a no longer needed service in the API Gateway Console.


## Directions
> If there are APIs in a service, it can be deleted only after all APIs are removed from it. If there are environments where the service is not deactivated, the service cannot be deleted directly either.

1. Log in to the [API Gateway Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/apigateway/index?rid=1) and select **Service** on the left sidebar.
2. Select the service to be edited from the service list and click **Delete** in the "Operation" column.
