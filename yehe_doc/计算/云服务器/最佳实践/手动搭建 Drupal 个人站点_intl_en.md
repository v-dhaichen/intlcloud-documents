To manually setup a Drupal-based personal website, you need to be familiar with Linux commands, such as [using YUM to install software on CentOS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2046). You should also be familiar with software usage and compatibility.

## Software
This article describes how to install the following software
- Linux operating system. This article uses CentOS 7.6.
- Apache is a web server software. This article uses Apache 2.4.6.
- MariaDB is a database management system. This article uses MariaDB 10.4.8.
- PHP is a scripting language. This article uses PHP 7.0.33.
- Drupal is a content management framework. This article uses Drupal 8.1.1.


## Prerequisites
You need a Linux CVM. If you have not purchased one yet, see [this article](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2936) for information on how to get started with a Linux CVM.


## Directions
### Step 1 Logging in to a Linux instance
[Log in to a Linux instance using WebShell (recommended)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436). You can also use other login methods that you are comfortable with:
- [Log in to a Linux instance using remote login software](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32502).
- [Log in to a Linux instance using SSH](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32501)

### Step 2 Setting up LAMP
After logging in, set up LAMP so you can run Drupal. Refer to [this article](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/34813) for details.

### Step 3 Downloading and installing Drupal
1. Run the following commands to download the Drupal install package to the root directory of your website.
```
cd /var/www/html/
```
```
wget wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-8.1.1.zip
```
2. Run the following commands to decompress the install package and rename the directory.
```
unzip drupal-8.1.1.zip 
```
```
mv drupal-8.1.1/ drupal/
```

### Step 4 Configuring Drupal
