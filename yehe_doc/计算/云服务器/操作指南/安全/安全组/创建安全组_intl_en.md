## Scenario
Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for CVMs. Each CVM instance must associate with at least one security group. By default, each CVM instance has two templates (**Open all ports** and **Open port 22, 80, 443, 3389 and ICMP protocol**) for creating a default security group. For details, refer to [Security Group Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/12452).

If the default security group does not meet your needs, you can create your own security group as instructed below.


## Directions

1. Log in to the [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index).
2. In the left sidebar, select **[Security Group](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup)**. The Security Group page then appears.
3. Select a region for the security group. Click **+New**. 
4. In the **Create a security group** page, complete the following configurations:
