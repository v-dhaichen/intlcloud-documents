## Scenario
If you no longer need a security group, you can delete it. Once a security group is deleted, all rules within it are also deleted.

## Prerequisites
Before deleting a security group, you must remove all associated CVM instances. Otherwise, the operation will fail. For details, refer to [Removing From Security Group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/34830).

## Directions

1. Log in to the [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index).
2. In the left sidebar, select **[Security Group](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup)**. The Security Group page then appears.
3. Select the desired region and find the security group to be deleted.
4. Locate the desired security group and click **Delete**.
5. In the pop-up window, click **OK**.
