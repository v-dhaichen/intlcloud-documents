## Description

This document describes common response headers that may be used in API requests. The headers mentioned below will not be addressed again in related API documents.

## Response Headers

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Header Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Type</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">Content-Length</td>
      <td>HTTP response length in bytes as defined in RFC 2616</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Content-Type</td>
      <td>HTTP response content type (MIME) as defined in RFC 2616.</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Connection</td>
      <td>Indicates whether the network connection will be turned off after the response completes, defined in RFC 2616. Enumerated values: `keep-alive`, `close`.</td>
      <td>Enum</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Date</td>
			<td>Server response time in GMT format as defined in RFC 1123, such as <code>Wed, 29 May 2019 04:10:12 GMT</code>.</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Etag</td>
      <td>An entity tag (ETag) is an information tag that identifies the content of an object when it is created. The tag can be used to check whether the content of the object has changed. For instance, the header <code>"8e0b617ca298a564c3331da28dcb50df"</code>does not necessarily return the MD5 value of the object, but varies depending on how the object is uploaded and encrypted.</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Server</td>
			<td>Name of the server that accepts the request and returns the response. Default value: <code>tencent-cos</code>. </td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">encoding-type</td>
      <td>Transfer encoding format as defined in RFC 2616.</ td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">x-cos-request-id</td>
      <td>An ID automatically generated by the server for each request when it is sent.</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>x-cos-trace-id</td>
      <td>An ID automatically generated by the server for each error when request fails. This header will be included in the response only if a request fails.</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
</table>


## Server-side encryption headers

For APIs that support server-side encryption (SSE) and use SSE in the request, the following response headers will be returned according to the specific encryption method. For more information, see [Server-side Encryption Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/18145).

### SSE-COS

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Header Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Type</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">x-cos-server-side-encryption</td>
      <td>If an object is uploaded with SSE-COS or an object encrypted with SSE-COS is downloaded, the response of the request will return this header, indicating the server-side encryption algorithm used during object upload.</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
</table>

### SSE-KMS

| Header Name | Description | Type |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| x-cos-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm | If an object is uploaded with SSE-C or an object encrypted with SSE-C is downloaded, the response of the request will return this header, indicating the server-side encryption algorithm used during object upload | string |
| x-cos-server-side-encryption-cos-kms-key-id | Returns the user master key (CMK) of the KMS, if not specified, the default CMK created by COS will be returned | string |

### SSE-C

| Header Name | Description | Type  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------ |
| x-cos-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm | If an object is uploaded with SSE-C or an object encrypted with SSE-C is downloaded, the response of the request will return this header, indicating the server-side encryption algorithm used during object upload | string |
| x-cos-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 | Base64-encoded MD5 hash of the server-side encryption key used during object upload. <br>For example, `U5L61r7jcwdNvT7frmUG8g==` | string |
