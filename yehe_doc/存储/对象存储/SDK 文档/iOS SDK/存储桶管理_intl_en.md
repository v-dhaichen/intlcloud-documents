## Cross-Origin Access

### Setting cross-origin configuration

#### Method Prototype

Before performing the CORS operation of configuring the bucket, you need to import the header file QCloudCOSXML/QCloudCOSXML.h. Before import, you need to complete [Initialization](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/8629#step1). First generate a QCloudPutBucketCORSRequest instance, enter additional restrictions as required, and then get the approved content. Detailed steps are as follows:    

1. Instantiate QCloudPutBucketCORSRequest, configure the bucket, and put the required CORS into QCloudCORSRule. If there are multiple CORS configurations, you can place multiple QCloudCORSRule in an NSArray, put the array into QCloudCORSConfiguration's rules attribute, and then into the request.    
2. Call the PutBucketCORS method in the QCloudCOSXMLService object to initiate the request.    
3. Obtain the setting result (error is empty or not) from finishBlock of callback, and perform additional operations if the setting is successful.   

#### QCloudPutBucketCORSRequest parameters

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---- |
| bucket | Bucket name, which can be found in the [COS V5 Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket), with a format of &lt;bucketName&gt;-&lt;APPID&gt;, such as testBucket-1253653367. | NSString* | Yes |
| corsConfiguration | Specific parameter that encapsulates CORS | QCloudCORSConfiguration * | Yes |

#### QCloudCORSConfiguration parameters

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ---- |
| rules | The array containing CORS. It is a QCloudCORSRule instance. | NSArray&lt;QCloudCORSRule`*` > * |

#### QCloudCORSRule parameters

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---- |
| identifier | ID of the configuration rule | NSString* |
| allowedMethod | Allowed HTTP operations. Enumerated values: GET, PUT, HEAD, POST, DELETE | NSArray &lt;NSString`*`>* |
| AllowedOrigins | String | | Allowed source origins. Wildcard `*` is supported. Format: `Protocol://domain name[:port]`, Example: `http://www.qq.com` | Yes |
| allowedHeader | It is used to notify the server about which custom HTTP request headers are allowed for subsequent requests when an OPTIONS request is sent. The wildcard "*" is supported. | NSArray&lt;NSString `*`>* | No |
| maxAgeSeconds | Configures the valid period of the results obtained by OPTIONS request | int |
| exposeHeader | Configures the custom header information that can be received by the browser from the server | NSString* |

#### Samples


Objective-C code sample:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-objc-put-bucket-cors)
```objective-c
QCloudPutBucketCORSRequest* putCORS = [QCloudPutBucketCORSRequest new];
QCloudCORSConfiguration* cors = [QCloudCORSConfiguration new];

QCloudCORSRule* rule = [QCloudCORSRule new];
rule.identifier = @"sdk";
rule.allowedHeader = @[@"origin",@"host",@"accept",@"content-type",@"authorization"];
rule.exposeHeader = @"ETag";
"AllowedMethod": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
rule.maxAgeSeconds = 3600;
rule.allowedOrigin = @"http://cloud.tencent.com";
cors.rules = @[rule];
putCORS.corsConfiguration = cors;
putCORS.bucket = @"examplebucket-1250000000";
[request setFinishBlock:^(id outputObject, NSError* error) {
    // You can get the header information returned by the server from outputObject
}];

[[QCloudCOSXMLService defaultCOSXML] PutBucketCORS:putCORS];
```

Swift code sample:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-swift-put-bucket-cors)
```swift
let putBucketCorsReq = QCloudPutBucketCORSRequest.init();

let corsConfig = QCloudCORSConfiguration.init();

let rule = QCloudCORSRule.init();
rule.identifier = "swift-sdk";
rule.allowedHeader = ["origin","host","accept","content-type","authorization"];
rule.exposeHeader = "Etag";
"AllowedMethod": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
rule.maxAgeSeconds = 3600;
rule.allowedOrigin = "*";

corsConfig.rules = [rule];

putBucketCorsReq.corsConfiguration = corsConfig;
putBucketCorsReq.bucket = "examplebucket-1250000000";
putBucketCorsReq.finishBlock = {(result,error) in
    if error != nil{
        print(error!);
    }else{
        print(result!);
    }}

QCloudCOSXMLService.defaultCOSXML().putBucketCORS(putBucketCorsReq);
```

#### Error Codes

When the SDK request fails, the error returned is not empty and includes the error code, error description, and other necessary debugging information to help developers quickly solve the problem.

Error codes (encapsulated in the returned error) include those returned by the device due to network problems and those returned by COS.

Error codes generated by the device due to network problems are negative four digits, for example -1001. These error codes are defined by Apple. For more information, see the definitions in the header file NSURLError.h or [Apple's official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/1508628-url_loading_system_error_codes).
Error codes returned by COS are based on HTTP status codes, such as 404 and 503. For solutions to these error codes, see [Error Codes](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7730) in COS official documentation.
- For SDK-defined custom error codes, they are all 5-digit positive numbers, such as 10000, 20000, etc. For solutions regarding these error codes, please refer to [SDK Error Code](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30610).

## Lifecycle

### Setting the lifecycle

#### Feature

COS allows you to manage the lifecycle of objects in buckets through lifecycle configuration that contains one or more rule sets that will be applied to a set of objects. Each rule defines an operation for COS.
There are two types of operations:

- Transition: Specify the time when an object is transitioned into another storage class. For example, you can choose to transition an object into STANDARD_IA (applicable to infrequent access) storage class 30 days after its creation.
- Expiration: Specify the expiration time of an Object. COS will automatically delete objects that have expired.
  Put Bucket Lifecycle is used to create a new lifecycle configuration for a Bucket. If the Bucket has been configured with a lifecycle, you can use this API to create a new configuration which will overwrite the existing one.

| expiration | Rule expiration attribute | QCloudLifecycleExpiration* | No |
| noncurrentVersionExpiration | Indicates when objects of non-current version expire | QCloudLifecycleExpiration* | No |

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ---- |
|Days | LifecycleConfiguration.Rule.Transition <br>or Expiration | Specifies the number of days between the last modified date of an object and the date when the operation corresponding to a rule is performed. If the operation is `Transition`, a valid value of this field should be a non-negative integer; if it is `Expiration`, a valid value of this field should be a positive integer. Maximum: 3,650 days | Integer | No |
| transitionDate | Specifies when to execute on the action corresponding to the rule | NSString* | No |

#### Error Codes

When the SDK request fails, the error returned is not empty and includes the error code, error description, and other necessary debugging information to help developers quickly solve the problem.

Error codes (encapsulated in the returned error) include those returned by the device due to network problems and those returned by COS.

Error codes generated by the device due to network problems are negative four digits, for example -1001. These error codes are defined by Apple. For more information, see the definitions in the header file NSURLError.h or [Apple's official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/1508628-url_loading_system_error_codes).
Error codes returned by COS are based on HTTP status codes, such as 404 and 503. For solutions to these error codes, see [Error Codes](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7730) in COS official documentation.
- For SDK-defined custom error codes, they are all 5-digit positive numbers, such as 10000, 20000, etc. For solutions regarding these error codes, please refer to [SDK Error Code](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30610).
