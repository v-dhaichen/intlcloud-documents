## Advanced APIs (Recommended)

This section encapsulates advanced APIs for uploading and copying. The user only needs to set the corresponding parameters. The APIs will decide internally whether to perform simple upload/copy or multipart upload/copy based on the file size. Before using the API, make sure you have completed initialization as instructed in [Getting Started](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/8629).

### Uploading an object

Refer to [Uploading an Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/8629#.E4.B8.8A.E4.BC.A0.E5.AF.B9.E8.B1.A1) in Getting Started.

### Resuming upload from breakpoint

> Resume upload from breakpoint only supports uploading files in the sandbox.

Multipart upload is used to upload a file larger than 1 MB. That is, split the file into multiple parts with each holding a size of 1 MB, and then upload these parts (4 at most) in parallel. Resuming upload from breakpoint is implemented on the basis that the uploaded parts are stored in the backend server.  

During multipart upload, resumeData for resuming upload is generated after you initialize multipart upload or cancel the upload. This is used to generate another upload request for resuming upload. The following example shows how to get ResumeData:


Objective-C code sample:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-objc-transfer-upload-object)
```objective-c
QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest* put = [QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest new];
put.object = @"exampleobject";
put.bucket = @"examplebucket-1250000000";
put.body = [@"testFileContent" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
// Set some upload parameters
put.initMultipleUploadFinishBlock = ^(QCloudInitiateMultipartUploadResult * multipleUploadInitResult,
    QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectResumeData resumeData) {
    // This block will be called back after the initial multipart upload is complete, so you can get resumeData,
    // and can generate a multipart upload request via resumeData
    QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest* request = [QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest
        requestWithRequestData:resumeData];
};
[put setSendProcessBlock:^(int64_t bytesSent, int64_t totalBytesSent,
    int64_t totalBytesExpectedToSend) {
    NSLog(@"upload %lld totalSend %lld aim %lld", bytesSent, totalBytesSent,
        totalBytesExpectedToSend);
}];
[put setFinishBlock:^(QCloudUploadObjectResult *result, NSError* error) {
    // You can get the result from result
}];

[[QCloudCOSTransferMangerService defaultCOSTransferManager] UploadObject:put];
// Discard a multipart upload and delete uploaded parts
[put abort:^(id outputObject, NSError *error) {
//
}];

//···When initialization is completed and upload is not completed
NSError* error;
//The following shows how resumeData is generated after the user cancels the upload
QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectResumeData resumeData = [put cancelByProductingResumeData:&error];
QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest* request = nil;
if (resumeData) {
    request = [QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest requestWithRequestData:resumeData];
}
//The generated request for resuming upload can be directly uploaded
[[QCloudCOSTransferMangerService defaultCOSTransferManager] UploadObject:request];
```

Swift code sample:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-swift-transfer-upload-object)
```swift
let uploadRequest = QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest<AnyObject>.init();
let dataBody:NSData? = "wrwrwrwrwrw".data(using: .utf8) as NSData?;
uploadRequest.body = dataBody!;
uploadRequest.bucket = "examplebucket-1250000000";
uploadRequest.object = "exampleobject";
// Set upload parameters
uploadRequest.initMultipleUploadFinishBlock = {(multipleUploadInitResult,resumeData) in
    // This block will be called back after the initial multipart upload is completed, so you can get resumeData and generate a multipart upload request through resumeData
    let resumeUploadRequest = QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest<AnyObject>.init(request: resumeData as Data?);
}
uploadRequest.sendProcessBlock = {(bytesSent , totalBytesSent , totalBytesExpectedToSend) in
    
}
uploadRequest.setFinish { (result, error) in
    if error != nil{
        print(error!)
    }else{
        // Get the result of the request from result
        print(result!);
    }}

QCloudCOSTransferMangerService.defaultCOSTransferManager().uploadObject(uploadRequest);

//···When initialization is completed and upload is not completed
var error:NSError?;
    //The following shows how resumeData is generated after the user cancels the upload
do {
    let resumedData = try uploadRequest.cancel(byProductingResumeData: &error);
        var resumeUploadRequest:QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest<AnyObject>;
             resumeUploadRequest = QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest<AnyObject>.init(request: resumedData as Data?);
             //The generated request for resuming upload can be directly uploaded
    if resumeUploadRequest != nil {
        QCloudCOSTransferMangerService.defaultCOSTransferManager().uploadObject(resumeUploadRequest!);
    }
             
} catch  {
    print("resumeData is blank");
    return;
}
```

Note: The multipart upload uses the serial mode where parts must be uploaded in sequence. Under the following circumstances, resuming upload from breakpoint cannot be used.

-The uploaded object is less than 1MB, and no multipart upload is performed.
- The simple upload API rather than the QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest class is used to upload files.
- Multipart upload initialization is not completed (the callback for completed upload initialization is yet to be called) when you cancel the generation of resumeData.

### Downloading an object

Refer to [Downloading an Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/8629#.E4.B8.8B.E8.BD.BD.E5.AF.B9.E8.B1.A1) in Getting Started.

- Replicating oibjects

#### Notes

Initialize a QCloudCOSXMLCopyObjectRequest object, and then call CopyObject of QCloudCOSTransferMangerService. Note that multipart copy is automatically used for large files, but users will not be aware of this process.  

>For cross-origin replication, the region of transferManager must be the same as that of the bucket.

#### QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest parameters

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |

QCloudCOSTransferMangerService.defaultCOSTransferManager().copyObject(copyRequest);
```

## Simple Operations

### Querying the object list

#### Feature

This API (GET Bucket (List Object)) is used to query some or all objects in a bucket.

#### Method Prototype

The header file QCloudCOSXML/QCloudCOSXML.h needs to be imported before bucket operations. Before that, you need to complete the initialization described in Getting Started by creating a QCloudGetBucketRequest instance and enter some additional restrictions as needed to get the approved content. Specific steps are as follows:

1. Instantiate QCloudGetBucketRequest and enter the required parameters.    
2. Call the GetBucket method in the QCloudCOSXMLService object to initiate a request.    
3. Obtain specific content from QCloudListBucketResult in finishBlock of callback.

| prefix | Prefix match, used to specify the prefix address of the returned file. | NSString * | No |
| delimiter | Delimiter is a sign. If Prefix exists, the same paths between Prefix and delimiter are grouped as the same type and defined as Common Prefix, and then all Common Prefixes are listed. If Prefix does not exist, the listing process starts from the beginning of the path. It can be considered as an ending symbol. For example, if you want a string to end with A, set delimiter to A. | NSString * | No |
| encodingType | Indicates the encoding method of the returned value. Available value: url | NSString * | No |
| marker | Entries are listed using UTF-8 binary order by default, starting from marker | NSString * | No |

```

Swift code sample:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-swift-get-bucket)
```swift
let getBucketReq = QCloudGetBucketRequest.init();
getBucketReq.bucket = "examplebucket-1250000000";
getBucketReq.maxKeys = 1000;
getBucketReq.setFinish { (result, error) in
    if error != nil{
        print(error!);
    }else{
        print( result!.commonPrefixes);
    }}
QCloudCOSXMLService.defaultCOSXML().getBucket(getBucketReq);
```
#### Error Codes

When the SDK request fails, the error returned is not empty and includes the error code, error description, and other necessary debugging information to help developers quickly solve the problem.

Error codes (encapsulated in the returned error) include those returned by the device due to network problems and those returned by COS.

Error codes generated by the device due to network problems are negative four digits, for example -1001. These error codes are defined by Apple. For more information, see the definitions in the header file NSURLError.h or [Apple's official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/1508628-url_loading_system_error_codes).
Error codes returned by COS are based on HTTP status codes, such as 404 and 503. For solutions to these error codes, see [Error Codes](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7730) in COS official documentation.
-For SDK custom error codes, they are all 5-digit positive numbers, such as 10000, 20000, etc. For such error codes, you can refer to the [SDK Error Code](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30610) for solutions.

### Uploading an object

#### Feature

Upload objects to the specified bucket (Put Object), simple upload is limited to small files (less than 20MB). Simple upload supports uploading files from memory.

>The number of access policies is up to 1000. Do not set object ACL control when you upload an object if it is not required. The object inherits the bucket permissions by default.

#### QCloudPutObjectRequest parameters

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ---- |
| Object | The object key is the unique identifier of the object in the bucket.<br>For example, in the object's access domain name `examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/doc/picture.jpg`, the object key is doc/picture.jpg, see [Object Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com) | NSString * | Yes |
| bucket | Bucket name, format is &lt;BucketName-APPID&gt;, such as examplebucket-1250000000 | NSString * | Yes |
| body | If a file is stored in the disk, it is the path of the file to be uploaded, and you can enter a variable of NSURL * type. If a file is stored in memory, you can enter a variable of NSData * type that contains the file binary data. | BodyType | Yes |
| storageClass | Object storage class. Enumerated values: STANDARD（QCloudCOSStorageStandard），STANDARD_IA（QCloudCOSStorageStandardIA), ARCHIVE (QCloudCOSStorageARCHIVE). Default values: STANDARD (QCloudCOSStorageStandard) | QCloudCOSStorageClass | No |
| CacheControl | Cache policy as defined in RFC 2616, which will be stored in the object metadata | String | No |
| ContentDisposition | Filename as defined in RFC 2616, which will be stored in the object metadata | String | No |
| expect | When expect=@"100-Continue" is used, the request content will not be sent until the receipt of response from server. | NSString * | No |
| Expires | Expiration time as defined in RFC 2616, which will be stored in the object metadata | String | No |
| x-cos-acl | It defines the ACL attribute of the object. Value range: private, public-read, and default; default value: default (i.e., inheriting the bucket's permissions); <br>**Note:** Currently, there can be up to 1,000 entries in one ACL. If you do not need access control for the object, use "default" for this parameter or simply leave it blank, so that the object will inherit the permissions of the bucket | String | No |
| GrantRead | Grants the grantee Read access in the format of `id="[OwnerUin]"` | String | No |
| GrantWrite | Grants the grantee Write access in the format of `id="[OwnerUin]"` | String | No |

### Restoring an archived object

#### Feature

This API (POST Object restore) is used to restore an archived object.

#### Method Prototype

The header file QCloudCOSXML/QCloudCOSXML.h needs to be imported before file operations. Before that, you need to complete the initialization described in Getting Started by creating a QCloudOptionsObjectRequest instance and enter some additional restrictions as needed to get the approved content. Specific steps are as follows:    

1. Instantiate QCloudPostObjectRestoreRequest and enter the object name and bucket name to be set.    
2. Call the method in the QCloudCOSXMLService object to initiate a request.    
3. Get the specific content in finishBlock callback.   

#### QCloudPostObjectRestoreRequest parameters

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---- |
| Object | The object key is the unique identifier of the object in the bucket.<br>For example, in the object's access domain name `examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/doc/picture.jpg`, the object key is doc/picture.jpg, see [Object Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com) | NSString * | Yes |
| bucket | Bucket name, which can be found in the [COS V5 Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket), with a format of &lt;bucketName&gt;-&lt;APPID&gt;, such as testBucket-1253653367. | NSString * | Yes |
| restoreRequest | Restore data configuration Information | QCloudRestoreRequest * | Yes |

QCloudRestoreRequest parameters

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ---- |
| days | Set expiration time for temporary copies | int64_t | Yes |
| CASJobParameters | Restored process type configuration information | CASJobParameters * | Yes |

CASJobParameters parameters

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | ---- |
| tier | Restore mode, three types are supported: <br> <li> Standard (standard mode, restore task is completed in 3-5 hours) <br> <li> Expedited (speed mode, restore task can be completed in 15 minutes) <br> <li> Bulk (batch mode, restore task is completed in 5-12 hours) | QCloudCASTier | Yes |

#### Samples


Objective-C code sample:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-objc-restore-object)
```objective-c
QCloudPostObjectRestoreRequest *req = [QCloudPostObjectRestoreRequest new];
req.bucket = @"examplebucket-1250000000";
req.object = @"exampleobject";
req.restoreRequest.days  = 10;
req.restoreRequest.CASJobParameters.tier =QCloudCASTierStandard;

[req setFinishBlock:^(id outputObject, NSError *error) {
    // You can get etag or custom header information in response from outputObject
}];

[[QCloudCOSXMLService defaultCOSXML] PostObjectRestore:req];
```

Swift code sample:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-swift-restore-object)
```swift
let restore = QCloudPostObjectRestoreRequest.init();
restore.bucket = "examplebucket-1250000000";
restore.object = "exampleobject";
restore.restoreRequest.days = 10;
restore.restoreRequest.casJobParameters.tier = .standard;
restore.finishBlock = {(result,error)in
    if error != nil{
        print(error!)
    }else{
        // You can get etag or custom header information in response from outputObject
        print(result!);
    }}
QCloudCOSXMLService.defaultCOSXML().postObjectRestore(restore);
```

#### Error Codes

When the SDK request fails, the error returned is not empty and includes the error code, error description, and other necessary debugging information to help developers quickly solve the problem.

Error codes (encapsulated in the returned error) include those returned by the device due to network problems and those returned by COS.

Error codes generated by the device due to network problems are negative four digits, for example -1001. These error codes are defined by Apple. For more information, see the definitions in the header file NSURLError.h or [Apple's official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/1508628-url_loading_system_error_codes).
Error codes returned by COS are based on HTTP status codes, such as 404 and 503. For solutions to these error codes, see [Error Codes](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7730) in COS official documentation.
-For SDK custom error codes, they are all 5-digit positive numbers, such as 10000, 20000, etc. For such error codes, you can refer to the [SDK Error Code](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30610) for solutions.

### Setting object ACL

The header file QCloudCOSXML/QCloudCOSXML.h needs to be imported before object operations. Before that, you need to complete the initialization described in Getting Started by creating a QCloudPutObjectACLRequest instance and enter some additional restrictions as needed to get the approved content. Specific steps are as follows:    

1. Instantiate QCloudPutObjectACLRequest, and enter the bucket name and additionally required parameters, such as authorization information.    
2. Call the method in the QCloudCOSXMLService object to initiate a request.    
3. Obtain whether the configuration is completed from finishBlock in callback. If error is null, configuration is successful.   

#### QCloudPutObjectACLRequest parameters

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ---- |
| bucket | Bucket name, which can be found in the [COS V5 Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket), with a format of &lt;bucketName&gt;-&lt;APPID&gt;, such as testBucket-1253653367. | NSString * | Yes |
| object | Object name | NSString * | Yes |
| x-cos-acl | It defines the ACL attribute of the object. Value range: private, public-read, and default; default value: default (i.e., inheriting the bucket's permissions); <br>**Note:** Currently, there can be up to 1,000 entries in one ACL. If you do not need access control for the object, use "default" for this parameter or simply leave it blank, so that the object will inherit the permissions of the bucket | String | No |
| GrantRead | Grants the grantee the read permission in the format of id="[OwnerUin]" | String | No |
| GrantWrite | Grants the grantee the write permission in the format of id="[OwnerUin]" | String | No |

## Adding custom headers

You can add custom headers as needed. Classes allowing addition of custom headers are provided with the attribute customHeaders:

```objective-c
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSMutableDictionary* customHeaders;
```

Key-value pairs in this attribute will be added to the HTTP headers of creation requests accordingly.

## Server Encryption

You can encrypt the uploaded objects in the following ways.

### Using server-side encryption with COS-hosted encryption keys (SSE-COS) to protect data

COS can automatically encrypt data as it is written to the IDC and automatically decrypt it when you access it. COS master key is used to apply AES-256 encryption to data.

You can achieve this by calling -(void)setCOSServerSideEncyption in the iOS SDK.

Objective-C code sample:
```objective-c
[request setCOSServerSideEncyption];
```

Swift code sample:
```swift
request.setCOSServerSideEncyption();
```

### Using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) to protect data

You can achieve this by calling -(void)setCOSServerSideEncyptionWithCustomerKey:(NSString *)customerKey in the iOS SDK.

>
>-The service operated on by this encryption requires HTTPS requests.
2. customerKey: The key provided by the user, which shall be a 32-byte string consisting of numbers, letters and strings. Chinese characters are not supported.
3. If the uploaded source file calls this method, it should also be called when downloading, querying, uploading and copying the source object using QCloudCOSXMLDownloadObjectRequest, QCloudHeadObjectRequest, QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest and QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest.

Objective-C code sample:
```objective-c
NSString *customKey = @"123456qwertyuioplkjhgfdsazxcvbnm";
[put setCOSServerSideEncyptionWithCustomerKey:customKey];
```

Swift code sample

```swift
let customKey = "123456qwertyuioplkjhgfdsazxcvbnm";
putObject.setCOSServerSideEncyptionWithCustomerKey(customKey);
```
