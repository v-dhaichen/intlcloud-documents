## Scenario
This document describes how to install an SSL certificate in IIS.
>
>- This document uses the domain name `www.domain.com` as an example.
>- This document takes Windows 10 as an example. The detailed steps vary slightly by OS version.
>
## Prerequisites
- The certificate package for the domain name `www.domain.com` in the SSL Certificate Service Console has been downloaded and decompressed to a local directory.
After decompression, you can get the IIS folder and CSR file:
 - Folder name: IIS
 - Folder content:
    - `www.domain.com.pfx`   Certificate file
    - `keystorePass.txt`   Password file
  - CSR file content: 	`www.domain.com.csr` file
- If you have already set a private key password when applying for the SSL certificate, there is no keystorePass.txt file in this folder.

>The CSR file is uploaded by you or generated online by the system when you apply for the certificate and is provided to the CA, which can be ignored during installation.

## Directions

### Certificate Installation
1. Open the IIS Manager, select the computer name, and double-click "Server Certificates" to open it, as shown below:

### Security Configuration for Automatic Redirect from HTTP to HTTPS (Optional)

Download and install the [URL Rewrite module](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite) before performing the following steps.
>
>- For normal redirect, edit the rule in the following steps. If you have other needs, you can set it on your own.
>- During the redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, if your website element contains external links or uses the HTTP protocol, the entire webpage is not completely based on HTTPS. In this case, some browsers may prompt for insecurity such as "this link is insecure" due to those factors. You can view the error reason by clicking "Details" on the insecure page.
