First, regardless of whether the SSL certificate is a free DV certificate or a paid OV certificate, CAs set a valid period for security reasons. You cannot guarantee that a legal website will never become a phishing website, so CAs conduct a regular review and do not issue permanently valid certificates.

Second, if the private key of a website is lost, you can apply for a certificate revocation. Then the CA adds the revoked certificate to a certificate revocation list (CRL). Whenever a HTTPS website is accessed, the browser retrieves the CRL from a CA to determine whether to trust the certificate. However, issuing permanently valid certificates will lead to an increasing CRL, which will increase the request traffic of browsers. Therefore, it is better to specify a valid period for a certificate.

Now, Tencent Cloud provides a free DV certificate with the model of **TrustAsia DV SSL CA - G5** and a valid period of 1 year**. The certificate can be re-applied **three months** before expiration. DV certificates can be issued quickly within one business day, so you have sufficient time to switch the certificate for the website.
