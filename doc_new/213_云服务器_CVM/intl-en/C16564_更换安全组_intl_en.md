Security group is a stateful virtual firewall for filtering packets and is used to set the network access controls for a single or multiple CVMs. It is a logical grouping and an important means of network security isolation. When a CVM instance is created, you must configure the security group for it. Tencent Cloud supports configuring a new security group for the CVM instance after it is created.


>**Note:**
>To configure a new security group for the instance, create a security group first. For more information, please see [Create Security Group](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/12450).
