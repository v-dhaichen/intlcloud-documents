### Bill-by-traffic

CVM is billed based on public network outbound traffic (in GB).

**Characteristics:** CVM is pay-as-you-go, you only pay for what you use. This flexible billing method reduces cost for customers with fluctuating network demands. You can set a bandwidth cap to avoid traffic surge fees. Once the cap is reached, packet loss will occur by default and no other costs will be incurred.



>**Note:**
>If you set the bandwidth to 0 Mbps, CVM instance will not be assigned a public IP and will not support outbound traffic. Thus, it cannot be used as public gateway. Please do so after careful consideration.

<!--Now, you can take a further look at [Exclusive Network Billing]() and [Shared Network Billing]() based on the network type of your CVM.-->
