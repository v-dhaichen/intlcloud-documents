2. Select a push/playback domain name and select the corresponding domain name that has been added to domain name management. AppName is the address path used to differentiate multiple applications under the same domain name, which is "live" by default.
>AppName can be customized and can contain only letters, numbers, and symbols. To customize it, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for configuration.
