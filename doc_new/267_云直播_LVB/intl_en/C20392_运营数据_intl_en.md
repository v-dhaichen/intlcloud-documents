You can query and view bandwidth, traffic, number of requests, and number of concurrent connections by domain name in a specified region or ISP on the [Operational Data](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/analysis/total) page in the LVB Console.
- Currently, overseas data is aggregated instead of country/ISP-specific.
> Overseas data refers to the traffic data generated by Tencent Cloud CDN for live streaming outside Mainland China, which does not use the IP addresses of clients as a statistical standard.
- You can view the data of one or multiple districts when querying the data for Mainland China. However, you cannot select multiple districts when querying data of more than one day.
