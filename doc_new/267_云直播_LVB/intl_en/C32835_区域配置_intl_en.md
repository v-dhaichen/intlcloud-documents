## Scenario
If your playback domain name needs content delivery, acceleration, and playback outside Mainland China, you need to switch to an overseas region by selecting one in the region configuration.

## Prerequisites
You have logged in to the [LVB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live).
## Directions
1. When adding a domain name or selecting a playback domain name, select the accelerated region for live streaming content delivery ("Mainland China", "Overseas, Hong Kong (China), Macao (China) and Taiwan (China)", and "Global acceleration") and click **Submit**.

3. In the **Advanced Configuration** tab, you can set and modify the region configuration for the playback domain name. Click **Edit** in **Region Configuration** to switch among "Mainland China", "Global Acceleration", and "Overseas, Hong Kong (China), Macao (China) and Taiwan (China)".


>- The playback address cannot be used properly in a non-accelerated region.
>- If the accelerated region covers Mainland China, you have to apply for an ICP filing for the playback domain name first.
