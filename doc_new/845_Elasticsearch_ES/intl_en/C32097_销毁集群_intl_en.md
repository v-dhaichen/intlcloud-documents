### Operation Scenario

If an ES cluster is no longer needed as your business changes, you can terminate it in the console to avoid further fees. If the cluster cannot meet your needs, you can also scale it to the appropriate specifications by adjusting its configuration. For more information, see [Adjusting Cluster Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/845/30944 ).

### Note on Fees
- Pay-as-you-go clusters are billed by the actual usage and can be terminated at any time. After the termination, no more fees will be incurred.

### Directions

1. Log in to the [ES Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/es).
2. You can terminate a cluster either on the cluster list page or the cluster details page.

 - On the cluster list page, select a cluster and select **More** > **Terminate** in the "Action" column.
