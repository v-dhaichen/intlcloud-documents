 ## 1. Terms and Definitions
1.1  **Cloud Elasticsearch Service** **(ES)**: Elasticsearch service means the Elasticsearch cluster hosting service provided by Tencent Cloud, including Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana service which is compatible with various Elasticsearch standard APIs. You may develop different application services based on Tencent Cloud Elasticsearch service according to your business needs. Tencent Cloud Elasticsearch service provides you with cluster operation, maintenance and management functions, such as cluster monitoring, cluster warning, cluster expansion and configuration modification.
    
1.2  **Service Month(s)**: Service Month(s) means the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you. For example, if you purchase the Service for a term of three months starting from March 17, there will be four (4) Service Months (the first Service Month from March 17 to March 31, the second from April 1 to April 30, the third from May 1 to May 31, and the fourth from June 1 to June 16). The availability of the Service will be calculated separately for each Service Month.
    
1.3  **Service Downtime**: If all attempted connections within five (5) minutes to designated Elasticsearch cluster fail, such five (5) minutes shall be deemed Service Downtime.
    
1.4  **Total Time of a Service Month Calculated in Minutes**: the number of days of the Service Month × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes).
    
1.5  **Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes within a Service Month**: If the Service is unavailable within five (5) minutes as described in article 1.3 above, such five (5) minutes shall count towards the Service Downtime of the Service Month; if the Service is available, such five (5) minutes shall count towards Service available time of the Service Month.
    
## 2. Service Availability

2.1  **Calculation of Service Availability**

Service Availability = 1 - (Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes within a Service Month / Total Time of a Service Month Calculated in Minutes) × 100%

2.2  **Standards of Service Availability**

The Service Availability of the Service provided by Tencent Cloud will be no less than 99.5%. You are entitled to the compensation as set forth in Section 3 below if the Service Availability fails to meet the aforementioned standard, other than in any circumstance as provided for in the release of liabilities provisions below.
## 3. Service Compensation

In respect of this Service, if the Service Availability fails to meet the abovementioned standard, you will be entitled to compensations in accordance with the following terms:

3.1  **Standards of Compensation**

\(1) Compensations will be made **in the form of coupon** by Tencent Cloud, and you should follow the rules for using the coupon (including the valid term; for details, please refer to the rules of coupons published on Tencent Cloud's official website). You cannot redeem such coupon for cash or request to issue an invoice for such coupon. Such coupon can only be used to purchase the Service by using your Tencent Cloud account. You cannot use the coupon to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the coupon to a third party for consideration or for free.

\(2) If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the standard, the amount of compensation will be calculated for such month independently, and **the aggregate amount shall be no more than the applicable monthly service fee paid by you for such month (**the monthly service fee referred herein shall exclude the portion deducted by a coupon or promotional voucher, due to discounted service fee or otherwise deducted).

  |Service Availability for a Service Month|   Value of Compensation Coupon|
|-|-|
  |≥ 98% and \< 99.5%|                         10% of the monthly service fee|
  |≥ 95% and \< 98%|                           25% of the monthly service fee|
  |\< 95%|                                     100% of the monthly service fee|

3.2  **Time Limit for Compensation Application**

\(1) If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the abovementioned Service Availability standard, you may apply for compensation **through (and only through) the support ticket system under your relevant account** after the fifth (5<sup>th</sup>) business day of the month immediately following such Service Month. Tencent Cloud will verify and ascertain your application upon receipt of such application. If there is any dispute over the calculation of the Service Availability for a Service Month, **both parties agree that the back-end record of Tencent Cloud will prevail**.

\(2) **You should apply for such compensation no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the expiry of the applicable Service Month in which the Service Availability fails to meet the standard**. If you fail to make any application within such period, or make the application after such period, or make the application by any means other than that agreed herein, it shall be deemed that you have voluntarily waived your right to apply for such compensation and any other rights you may have against Tencent Cloud, in which case Tencent Cloud has the right to reject your application for compensation and not to make any compensation to you.
