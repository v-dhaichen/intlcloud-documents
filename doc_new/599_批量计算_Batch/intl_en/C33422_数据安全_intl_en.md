Batch Compute is a computing service that encrypts sensitive data in computing environment, jobs and task templates and stores Ciphertext persistently in TencentDB.

### Data Storage

Batch Compute provides compute capability and performs task scheduling. However, when using Batch Compute, the generated data will not be kept in the service but stored in Tencent Cloud storage products, such as Cloud Block Storage, Cloud Message Queue, Cloud Object Storage and Cloud File Storage.
