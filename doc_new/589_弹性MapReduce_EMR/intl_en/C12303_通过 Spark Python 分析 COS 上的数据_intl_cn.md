This section describes running a Spark wordcount application in Python.
## 1. Prerequisites
- You need to [create a bucket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6232) in COS for this task.
- Confirm that you have activated Tencent Cloud and created an EMR cluster. When creating your EMR cluster, click the Spark component on the software configuration page, click "Enable COS" on the basic configuration page and then enter your SecretId and SecretKey. You can find your SecretId and SecretKey at [API Key Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi). If you don’t have a SecretKey, click **Create a Key** to create one.

## 2. Data Preparations
Upload the to-be-processed file to COS first. If the file is in your local file system, upload it directly via the [COS Console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13321); if it is in the EMR cluster, upload it by running the following Hadoop command:

`[hadoop@10 hadoop]$ hadoop fs -put $testfile cosn:// $bucketname/`

Here, $testfile is the full path with file name and $bucketname is your bucket name. After the upload is completed, you can check whether the file is available in COS.

## 3.	Running the Demo
First, log in to any node (preferably a master one) in the EMR cluster. For more information about how to log in to EMR, see [Logging in to a Linux Instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436). Here, you can use WebShell to log in.  Click *Login* button on the right of the desired CVM instance and then enter the login page. The default username is root, and the password is the one you set when you created the EMR cluster. Once your credentials have been validated, you can access the command-line interface.

Run the following command on the EMR command-line interface to switch to the Hadoop user and go to the Spark installation directory `/usr/local/service/spark`:
```
[root@172 ~]# su Hadoop
[hadoop@172 root]$ cd /usr/local/service/spark
```
Create a Python file named wordcount.py and add the following code:
```
from __future__ import print_function

import sys 
from operator import add
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: wordcount <file>", file=sys.stderr)
        exit(-1)

    spark = SparkSession\
        .builder\
        .appName("PythonWordCount")\
        .getOrCreate()

    sc = spark.sparkContext

    lines = spark.read.text(sys.argv[1]).rdd.map(lambda r: r[0])
    counts = lines.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(' ')) \
                  .map(lambda x: (x, 1)) \
                  .reduceByKey(add)

    output = counts.collect()
    counts.saveAsTextFile(sys.argv[2])

    spark.stop()
```
Submit the task by running the following command:
```
[hadoop@10   spark]$   ./bin/spark-submit   --master yarn   ./wordcount.py 
cosn://$bucketname/$yourtestfile cosn:// $bucketname/$output
```
Here, $bucketname is your COS bucket name, $yourtestfile is the full path with test file name in the bucket, and $output is your output folder. **If the $output folder already exists before the command is executed, the program will fail.**

After the program is running automatically, you can find the output file in the destination bucket:
```
[hadoop@172 spark]$ hadoop fs -ls cosn:// $bucketname/$output
Found 2 items
-rw-rw-rw- 1 hadoop Hadoop 0 2018-06-29 15:35 cosn:// $bucketname/$output /_SUCCESS
-rw-rw-rw- 1 hadoop Hadoop 2102 2018-06-29 15:34 cosn:// $bucketname/$output /part-00000
```
You can also look up the the result by running the following command:
```
[hadoop@172 spark]$ hadoop fs -cat cosn:// $bucketname/$output /part-00000
(u'', 27)
(u'code', 1)
(u'both', 1)
(u'Hadoop', 1)
(u'Bureau', 1)
(u'Department', 1)
```
You can also output the result to HDFS by changing the output location in the command as follows:
```
[hadoop@10spark]$   ./bin/spark-submit   ./wordcount.py
cosn://$bucketname/$yourtestfile /user/hadoop/$output
```
Here, `/user/hadoop/` is the path in HDFS, which can be created on your own if not present.
After the task is completed, you can view the Spark execution log by running the following command:

`[hadoop@10 spark]$  /usr/local/service/hadoop/bin/yarn logs -applicationId $yourId`

Here, $yourId should be replaced with your task ID, which can be viewed in Yarn's WebUI.
