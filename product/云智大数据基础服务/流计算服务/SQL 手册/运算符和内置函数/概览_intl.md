This document introduces the built-in operators and functions of SCS system. The syntax used in the following documents is as follows:
 `{ }`means that you can either select one of the options, or left it empty. For example { BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING } means that you may left it empty (default behavior is used), or use one of BOTH, LEADING or TRAILING. Each item has a different function.

 `[ ]` indicates an optional field and `*` means to repeat the content in `[ ]` for 0 or several times. For example, `[, value]*` indicates that there are 0 or several ", value". It is used to represent indeterminate number of parameters, such as value, value, value ... value.

 A string of lowercase letters represents a variable, such as value1, value, boolean and numeric, while a string of uppercase letters (such as IS and NULL) or symbols (such as = and <) represents an operator or a built-in function.
