3. Set permissions. When it has been associated with a policy, the sub-user will be automatically granted the permissions described in that policy. You can give sub-user permission in 3 different ways:
 - Add sub-users to a user group: This is the best way to manage permissions for users with different roles and functions. You can grant permissions to a sub-user by adding the sub-user to an existing user group or creating a new user group. After that, the sub-user will be associated with the policies of the user group.
