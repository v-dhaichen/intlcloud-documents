2. Enter the user information. We recommend that you turn on login protection and sensitive operations protection.

3. Set permissions. You can set permissions for the created collaborator in the following three ways. When associated with a policy, the collaborator can be granted the permissions described in the policy.
 - User groups: This is the best way to manage user permissions according to their functions. You can grant permissions to a collaborator by adding the collaborator to an existing user group or creating a new user group. The collaborator then will be associated with the policy of that user group.
