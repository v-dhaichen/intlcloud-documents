## MQTT Channel and Security Level

TLSV1, TLSV1.1 and TLSV1.2 protocols are supported to establish a secure connection with high security level.

## TOPIC Specification

By default, after a product is created, all devices under the product have the permissions of the following topic classes:
1. `${productId}/${deviceName}/control` for subscription.
2. `${productId}/${deviceName}/event` for publishing.
3. `$shadow/operation/${productId}/${deviceName}` for publishing.
    Categorized by the internal type of the packet: update/get, which correspond to the operation of updating and pulling the device shadow document.
4. `$shadow/operation/result/${productId}/${deviceName}` for subscription.
    Categorized by internal type of the packet: update/get/delta; update and get correspond to the operation of updating and pulling the device shadow document; after you modify the device shadow document through the restAPI, the server will publish messages through this topic where the type is delta.
