The following describes how to port the device-side C-SDK to the target hardware platform.

<!--### <font color=gray>Device-side C-SDK overview</font>
-->
The SDK can be roughly divided into four parts according to the code structure:
![](http://qzonestyle.gtimg.cn/qzone/vas/opensns/res/doc/SDK代码结构v1.2.jpg)

1. Hardware abstraction layer (HAL)

This layer is to abstract the supporting fuctions, such as network functions, memory request and TLS/DTLS tunnel creation, for different embedded operation system in the SDK.

> Note:
	
> - Implementing this part is the first step in any cross-platform porting.
	
> - Implement the HAL first during porting. The HAL provided in the C-SDK is a reference implementation based on the Linux desktop OS (Ubuntu 14.04).
		
2. SDK kernel implementation layer

This is the core implementation part of the C-SDK, which encapsulates features such as the MQTT channel based on the HAL API.

> Note:
	
> As long as the HAL is implemented, there is generally no need to be concerned about the specific implementation of this layer of code besides debugging.

3. SDK API declaration layer

 - This includes a series of prototype declarations of C functions for writing business logic and implementing the APIs for communicating with Tencent Cloud.
 
 - 	The demo code is provided in sample, which demonstrates how to use these APIs.

4. SDK sample program

 This section provides the implementation code for the scenario-based demo for your reference.
 See below for more information regarding different layers.

### Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

All HAL functions are declared in `src/sdk-impl/qcloud_iot_import.h`. The following are the HAL APIs that need to be implemented. For details, see the comments.
<!--2. `src/sdk-impl/qcloud_iot_import.h` contains the subfiles in the `imports` directory.
--><!--`3. The HAL API dependencies introduced by each feature point are listed in `src/sdk-impl/imports/qcloud_iot_import_*.h``-->

**Must be implemented:**

| No. | Function name | Description |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1 | HAL_Free | Release memory blocks |
| 2 | HAL_Malloc | Allocate a block of memory and return a pointer pointing to the beginning of the block |
| 3 | HAL_Printf | Write formatted data to a standard output stream |
| 4 | HAL_Snprintf | Write formatted data to a string |
| 5 | HAL_UptimeMs | Retrieve the number of milliseconds that elapsed since the system has started |
| 6 | HAL_SleepMs | Sleep |
| 7 | HAL_Timer_init | Initialize the timer structure |
| 8 | HAL_Timer_remain | Check the remaining time of the given timer |
| 9 | HAL_Timer_expired | Determine whether the timer has expired |
| 10 | HAL_Timer_countdown | Start timing according to the timer in seconds |
| 11 | HAL_Timer_countdown_ms | Start timing according to the timer in milliseconds |
| 12 | HAL_Timer_current | Get the formatted string of the current time |
| 13 | HAL_TLS_Connect | Establish a TLS connection for the MQTT client |
| 14 | HAL_TLS_Disconnect | Close the TLS connection |
| 15 | HAL_TLS_Write | Write data from a TLS connection |
| 16 | HAL_TLS_Read | Read data from a TLS connection |
| 17 | HAL_MutexCreate | Create mutex |
| 18 | HAL_MutexDestroy | Destroy mutex |
| 19 | HAL_MutexLock | Lock mutex |
| 20 | HAL_MutexUnlock | Unlock mutex |

**Must be implemented only when using CoAP:**

| No. | Function name | Description |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1 | HAL_DTLS_Connect | Establish a DTLS connection for the CoAP client; implemented only if you need to use CoAP |
| 2 | HAL_DTLS_Disconnect | Close the DTLS connection |
| 3 | HAL_DTLS_Write | Write data from a DTLS connection |
| 4 | HAL_DTLS_Read | Read data from a DTLS connection |


### SDK Kernel Implementation Layer

1. The declarations of all provided functions are listed in the header file `src/sdk-impl/qcloud_iot_export.h`.
2. The subfiles in these exports directory are included in `src/sdk-impl/qcloud_iot_export.h`.
3. The APIs provided by each feature point are listed in `src/sdk-impl/exports/qcloud_iot_export_*.h`.
