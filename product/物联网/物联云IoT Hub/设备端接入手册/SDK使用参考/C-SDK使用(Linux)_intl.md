## Compilation

Please first download the latest version of the device-side C language SDK [here](https://github.com/tencentyun/qcloud-iot-sdk-embedded-c/releases).

After decompression, open the compilation configuration file ```make.settings``` and edit the configuration items as needed.

```
BUILD_TYPE                    = release	#release/debug

PLATFORM_CC                   = gcc
PLATFORM_AR                   = ar
PLATFORM_OS                   = linux
PLATFORM_SSL                  = mbedtls

#
# Uncomment below and specify PATH to your toolchain when cross-compile SDK

# PLATFORM_CC                 = armcc
# PLATFORM_AR                 = armar

FEATURE_MQTT_COMM_ENABLED     = y    # Whether to turn on the master switch of the MQTT channel
FEATURE_MQTT_DEVICE_SHADOW    = y    # Whether to turn on the master switch of the device shadow
FEATURE_COAP_COMM_ENABLED     = y    # Whether to turn on the master switch of the CoAP channel
FEATURE_NBIOT_COMM_ENABLED    = y    # Whether to turn on the message assembly of the NB-IoT channel

FEATURE_OTA_COMM_ENABLED      = y    # Whether to turn on the master switch of the OTA firmware upgrade
FEATURE_OTA_SIGNAL_CHANNEL    = MQTT # OTA signaling channel type: MQTT/CoAP

FEATURE_AUTH_MODE             = CERT # MQTT/CoAP access authentication method; CERT: authentication with certificate; KEY: authentication with key
FEATURE_AUTH_WITH_NOTLS       = n    # Whether not to use TLS for access authentication; TLS is required for authentication with certificate, but it is optional for authentication with key

FEATURE_SYSTEM_COMM_ENABLED   = y    # Whether to enable the function to get the IoT backend time
```
