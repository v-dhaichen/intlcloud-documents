# Using the Device-side SDK

There are two scenarios for using device-side SDK:

- If app and IoT-SDK run in the same process, then app only has to rely on iot_core module.
- If app and IoT-SDK need to run in different processes, then app only has to rely on the iot_service module.

**Note:**
- The iot_service module relies on the iot_core module.
- The iot_core module relies on the MQTT protocol **eclipse.paho** implemented by the open-source community.
