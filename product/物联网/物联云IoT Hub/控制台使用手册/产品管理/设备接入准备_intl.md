Before IoT devices can be connected to the cloud platform, you need to create virtual products and devices in the IoT Hub Console and map them with actual devices. IoT Hub platform assigns a unique access authentication identifier to each device.

## Creating a Product

1. Log in to the [IoT Hub Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/iotcloud).
2. Click **Create Product**, enter "Product name" and "Product description", select "Region", "Product type", "Authentication method" and "Data format", and click **Create** to generate the product. A product is essentially a collection of devices of a certain type, and you can manage all the devices through the product.

 - Product type:
 Standard products use wireless communication (2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi) or wired communication, and you can perform secondary development on their communication modules.
 NB-IoT products use NB-IoT wireless communication, and you can use the ISP's communication module for communication through the serial port AT commands.
 - Product name: 1-32 letters, numbers and underscores, which can be modified.
 - Authentication method:
 When creating a device using certificate authentication, IoT platform generates a certificate file and a private key file for the device, which are used for device authentication before IoT Hub connection.
 When creating a device using key authentication, you can use a customized PSK or a PSK randomly generated by the IoT platform.
 - Data format: JSON format supports data-based rule matching and content extraction, while custom format does not support any data analysis.
 - Product description: 0-2048 characters.

## Deleting a Product
After the product is created, you can see product's basic information in the "Product Settings" tab. When the product is no longer needed, you can click **Delete** to delete it.

## Creating a Device

Once the product is created, you can add devices to the product.
1. Click **Device List** tab for the product.
2. Click **Add Device**.
 
 - Device name: 1-48 letters, numbers and underscores.
 - Device category: 1-16 Chinese characters, letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores.
 - Device note: 1-16 Chinese characters, letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores.
 - Key: A 4-64-bit Base64-encoded string.
 - ISP type: if the product type is NB-IoT, you can select China Telecom NB-IoT, China Mobile NB-IoT or China Unicom NB-IoT. Currently, only China Telecom NB-IoT is supported.
 - IMEI: if the product type is NB-IoT, you can enter the IMEI. It consists of 15 numbers.
> 1. The device cannot be renamed. Please name it carefully.
> 2. The device name must be unique under the same product.
> 3. The key option will appear only when the product is key-authenticated; the custom key must be a Base64-encoded string. You can enter a normal string in the input box and click the **Convert to Base64** button to convert it to a Base64-encoded string.

If certificate authentication is chosen as the product authentication method, the device private key will be IoT Hub backendâ€™s only identifier and will not be stored by the backend. Keep your private key safe and secure.

## Device Details

1. Certificate authentication is chosen as the authentication method:
Device details include all management content for a single device such as device name, device category, device note, online status, version information, device certificate (click to download) and device shadow status.

2. Key authentication is chosen as the authentication method:
Device details include all management content for a single device such as device name, device category, device notes, online status, version information, device key (click to show), device shadow status, ISP type (for NB-IoT products) and IMEI (for NB-IoT products).
