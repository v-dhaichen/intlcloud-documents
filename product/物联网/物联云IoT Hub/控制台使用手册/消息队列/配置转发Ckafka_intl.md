## Configuring Message Queue
### Configuring Push Type
There are two types of messages configured for CKafka: "device-reported message" and "device status change notification". After selecting the message type as needed, click the **Activate Now** button and a confirmation window will pop up. After **OK** is clicked, IoT Hub will immediately push the selected type of messages to the default queue ```topic-iot-{productID}```.
> **Note:**
> 
> 1. The message type cannot be empty;
> 2. The modified message type cannot be the same as the last configured one.

### Configuring Push Instance
Select the instance you want to push. If the current account has no instances, go to [CKafka Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ckafka) to purchase and create instances. Upon creation, the message queue page will display the details of the subscription. You can also modify the subscribed message type and instance type on this page, as shown in the red box below.
