## Overview
The rule engine allows rule configuration and can forward eligible device-reported data to the message queuing service [Ckafka](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/CKafka). Your application server can then read data in Ckafka and process data. Ckafka's strong handling capacity is leveraged to enable accessible communication.
The figure below shows the entire process of forwarding data to Ckafka by the rule engine:
