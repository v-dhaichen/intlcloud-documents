Once the rule is created, you can write SQL to process the data from a certain topic type. The IoT Hub Console supports SQL writing to simplify SQL statements generation. The console filters topic data using the  conditions in the red box below.

The rule expressed in the example below is:
Extract the ```action targetDevice count``` field of the JSON message in the ```E23VBC3GE8/device_02/event``` topic and filter the data by ```count <=3``` to get the final processed data for further data forwarding.

## Actions
When you extract the desired fields from the topic, you should consider performing some operations on them, such as forwarding or storage. Currently supported operations include:
- Data forwarding to another topic
- Data forwarding to third-party services
- Data forwarding to CKafka
- Data forwarding to CMQ topic
- Data forwarding to CTSDB
- Data forwarding to TencentDB for MySQL
- Data forwarding to TencentDB for MongoDB

## For Reference

### Detailed Topic Wildcard Definition

If you want to monitor multiple topics, you can use the ```#``` and ```+``` wildcards to define them.
 - ```#``` represents 0 or more arbitrary topic segments, which can only be placed at the end of the topic.
 - ```+``` represents 1 arbitrary topic segment, which can be placed in the middle of the topic.

For example:, ```house_monitor/+/get```
can monitor topics such as ```house_monitor/thermometer/get``` and ```house_monitor/door/get```;
however, it cannot monitor the topic ```house_monitor/door/switch/get```, because ```+``` can only represent 1 topic segment.

For example, ```house_monitor/#```
can monitor topics such as ```house_monitor/thermometer``` and ```house_monitor/door/switch/get```;
however, ```house/#/get``` is invalid, because ```#``` can only be placed at the end of the topic.

### Detailed Condition Definition
The [condition] expression is used to filter the messages in the topic. Only when a message satisfies the [condition] expression will it be extracted for further processing. The table below lists the supported expressions:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
|= | Equal to | color = 'red'|
| <> | Not equal to | color <> 'red' |
| AND | Logic and | color = 'red' AND siren = 'on' |
| OR | Logic or | color = 'red' OR siren = 'on' |
| ( ) | The content in the parentheses is a complete entity | color = 'red' AND (siren = 'on' OR isTest) |
|+ | Arithmetic addition | 4 + 5 |
| - | Arithmetic subtraction | 5 - 4 |
| / | Division | 20 / 4 |
|* | Multiplication | 5 * 4 |
| % | Remainder | 20 % 6 |
| < | Less than | 5 < 6 |
| <= | Less than or equal to | 5 <= 6 |
| > | Greater than | 6 > 5 |
| >= | Greater than or equal to | 6 >= 5 |
| CASE … WHEN … THEN … ELSE …END | Case expression | CASE col WHEN 1 THEN 'Y' WHEN 0 THEN 'N' ELSE '' END as flag|
| IN | Only enumeration is supported; sub-query is not supported. | For example, where a in(1,2,3); the following form is not supported: where a in(select xxx) |
