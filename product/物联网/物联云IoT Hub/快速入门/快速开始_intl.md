- Scenario 2: It describes how the user can set the air conditioner temperature and check the energy consumption of the air conditioner using an app.

The demo involves the following features of IoT Hub:
- Message publishing and subscription
- Device shadow-based status reporting and configuration sending
- Rule engine-based device message communication

Developers can refer to the demo and customize based on their own needs:
