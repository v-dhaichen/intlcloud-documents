### Cross-regional Access and Automated Scheduling
The deployment of IoT Hub's access layer has expanded from one region (Guangzhou) to three regions (Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing), making it easy for local access by devices. In addition, based on QQ's network access node quality detection platform, the actual access to IoT Hub is scheduled accordingly to improve fault detection and access quality.
