### Data Forwarding to CKafka
The rule engine allows you to configure rules to forward the eligible device-reported data to the Ckafka message queuing service, your application server can then read the data from Ckafka for processing. This takes advantage of Ckafka's high throughput to create a highly available message linkage for you.
