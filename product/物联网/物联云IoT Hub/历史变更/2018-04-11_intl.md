### Data Forwarding to CMQ Topic
Tencent Cloud Message Queue (CMQ) is a distributed message queuing service that provides a reliable message-based async communication mechanism. It enables message receiving/sending among different applications deployed in a distributed manner (or different components of the same application) and stores the messages in reliable and valid CMQ queues to prevent message loss. It supports multi-process simultaneous read-write, so that the message sending and receiving do not interfere with each other, eliminating the need for the applications or components to keep running.
