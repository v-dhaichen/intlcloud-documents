### Binary Data Supported by Rule Engine
The data supported by the rule engine is extended from JSON to binary format (the data format should be defined when the product is created), making it applicable to more scenarios such as private protocols and encrypted data. Data filtering and cleansing are not available when forwarding binary data.
