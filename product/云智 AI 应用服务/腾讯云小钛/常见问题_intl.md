TICSR automatically answers customer inquiries on various channels including WeChat Official Accounts and Mini Programs, webpages and apps, which helps companies cut labor costs.

### Which channels are supported by TICSR for access?

Customer service bots can be accessed through various channels such as WeChat Official Accounts, WeChat Mini Programs, desktop websites, HTML5 webpages and API.

### Can one bot be associated with multiple websites and WeChat Official Accounts?

A: Yes. There is no limit for the number of channels that one bot can be associated with, so it can be associated with multiple websites and WeChat Official Accounts, and the answers to the same question are the same in different channels. If the knowledge points vary for different channels, we recommend purchasing multiple bots for multiple channels.
