## Knowledge Base
Knowledge base is used to locate customer questions. Bot will automatically answer customers if matching knowledge points exist in the knowledge base. Otherwise, it won't be able to answer. Bot can keep supplementing knowledge base by question learning so that customer intents can be accurately identified.
Knowledge base consists of professional Q&As, chitchat, synonyms and industry-specific knowledge base.

### Professional Q&As
You can view standard Q&As in **Knowledge Base Management** > **Knowledge Base** > **Professional Q&As**.
Professional Q&As is the most important part of knowledge base as it effectively improves the bot’s question answering capability. Professional Q&As are logged as question and answer pairs.

Using the knowledge base:
1. Select a knowledge category
2. Add a question
3. Add similar questions
4. Review the knowledge base
5. Test Q&As
6. Knowledge Maintenance

#### 1. Select a knowledge category
Selecting a knowledge category to better query and manage  knowledge rules. You can view professional Q&As in a certain category. The categories can be added, edited, sorted and deleted.

#### 2. Add a standard question
In **Knowledge Base Management** > **Knowledge Base** > **Professional Q&As**, click **Add a question** to enter standard questions, similar questions and standard answers. An answer can be text, hyperlink or image.
Basic principles for question formatting:
- Similar questions should not be too short.
- There must be subjects and predicates.
- Intent must be complete. An answer can be given based on the question without any further probing.
 Correct question examples: What should I do if I lost my train ticket? How to upload an image? How long does it take to deliver the product?
 Incorrect question examples: train station, image, delivery
 Example of knowledge to be entered:
 Standard question: Where is Wuhan Railway Station?
 Similar question: Where is Wuchang Railway Station located? / How to get to Wuchang Railway Station? / How can I get to Wuchang Railway Station? /······
 Answer: Wuchang Railway Station is located at 642 Zhongshan Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan.

**New knowledge points are by default enabled and permanently valid. You can disable or set validity periods based on your needs. Batch configuration is also supported.**

#### 3. Add similar questions
Similar questions can be added to increase the match rate. The more similar questions, the higher the match rate. It is generally required to add 5 or more similar questions.
You can add similar questions in two ways:
- When adding a standard question, add a similar question in the similar question input box on the next line (up to 150 questions can be added).
- Add all similar questions after adding standard questions.
  If no similar questions has been added, you can export the existing knowledge points from the knowledge base and then add similar questions for the knowledge points in batches.

#### 4. Add associated questions
Associated questions are questions that are relevant to a given question, such as a different concern for the same matter. When a customer asks a question, the system will list associated questions while giving the answer.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/9412a2e0cd1c1758658a5b5c85eed6c0.png)
After adding a standard question, click **Add an associated question** in the lower left corner of the answer input box to add an associated question.
You can turn on/off the automatic recommendation of associated questions (off by default) in **System Management** > **Bot Settings** > **Associated Questions**.

#### 5. Batch add
When using the bot for the first time, it is recommended that you enter the FAQs in the form of Q&A pair into the Excel template we provide for batch import into the knowledge base. The batch addition steps are as follows:
1. In **Knowledge Base Management** > **Knowledge Base**, click **Batch Import** and download the "Professional Q&As Template" in the popup.
2. Enter standard questions, categories, answers, similar questions and associated questions into the appropriate cells in the Excel file.
3. After completing the template, click **Batch Import** in **Knowledge Base Management** > **Knowledge Base** to upload the completed file.
4. After uploading, you can check the quantities of successfully uploaded/failed questions. If the upload fails, please check whether the file format and size are correct and whether the number of entries is within the limit, correct if necessary and then retry.

#### 6. Review the knowledge base
You can review the entered knowledge in **Knowledge Base Management** > **Knowledge Base** > **Pending tasks** > **Professional Q&As** > **To be reviewed**.
- The knowledge entered by an admin does not need to be reviewed and can be included directly into the knowledge base.
- The knowledge entered by an agent needs to be reviewed by an admin and will be included into the knowledge base after approval (if it is rejected, it can be re-submitted after the question/answer is modified).

#### 7. Knowledge Maintenance
During actual use, you need to constantly modify and improve the knowledge base:
- Delete duplicate and obsoleted knowledge on a regular basis.
- Adjust the way of composing questions appropriately based on real customer questions.
- Add more similar questions to better understand customer intents and improve the efficiency and match rate of knowledge points.
- Intelligently learn similar questions and unknown questions.

### Chitchat conversations

#### Add chitchat Q&As

Chitchat refers to conversations that have nothing to do with the professional Q&As, such as "The weather is really good". Chitchat is enabled by default in the system, and a common chitchat corpus is configured (i.e., the default chitchat conversations). In addition to the default chitchat corpus, you can also configure a personal chitchat corpus where text, images and hyperlinks can be added as answers.
You can add, edit and delete chitchat conversations in **Knowledge Base Management** > **Knowledge base** > **Chitchat conversations**. Example of chitchat conversation:

1. In **Knowledge Base Management** > **Knowledge Base**, select the **Industry-specific knowledge base** tab.
2. Click **Import** for your industry to import your industry-specific knowledge base.

>! Industry-specific knowledge base will be effective immediately after importing. Please ensure that the knowledge base you are importing matches the industry. Enter Professional Q&As to delete the knowledge base if you made a mistake.

## Testing Q&As

You can start a test conversation with the bot in **Knowledge Base Management** > **Q&As Test**. If no answer is found for a question, you can optimize the relevant knowledge point according to the matching results. **The system will retain the test results of the past 3 days. You can add test questions directly to the knowledge base if needed.**
You can optimize the knowledge base according to the different types of matches in the test results.

**Match type:**
- Exact match: The bot directly matches the customer questions with standard or similar questions in the knowledge base.
- Fuzzy match: If the customer question is not clear enough, the bot will probe for further elaboration.
- Fallback match: The bot replies with a fallback answer to a customer question that cannot be understood.
- Chitchat: The bot recognizes the question as a chitchat conversation.



## Pending Tasks
- Incomplete Q&A pairs and synonym pairs in the knowledge base will be transferred to the **Pending Tasks** > **To be edited** list.
- Complete Q&A pairs and synonym pairs added to the knowledge base by an agent will be transferred to the **Pending tasks** > **Pending Review** list.

## Smart Learning
To better understand customer intention, improve efficiency and knowledge match rate, it is necessary for bots to undergo smart learning, delete duplicate and obsoleted knowledge on a regular basis, modify questions according to real customer inputs and add more similar questions.

### Smart training
You can make customer service bots smarter and increase their answer accuracy by training them.
Smart training is divided into knowledge base conditions and learning conditions:
- **Knowledge base conditions**: The system will calculate the average similarity of current questions in the knowledge base. The higher the average similarity, the smarter the bot. Click "Supplement" to add a similar question to trigger bot training.
- **Learning conditions**: This refers to the learning based on current similar questions, unknown questions and dissatisfaction analysis. Click "Supplement" to edit the corresponding module.

#### Training the bot
You can train bots by clicking "Train the bot" in smart learning.
There are six stages in bot training: rudimentary, beginner, intermediate, enhanced, advanced and mature. Their numbers of similar questions are 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 respectively. You need to meet similar question numbers and have no pending content to trigger training.
There will be one training after meeting corresponding bot training condition. There will be no training if there is no newly added content.

### Learn similar questions
Similar questions are questions that are of high quality and can be associated with standard questions. It is recommended to select "Approve" or "Associate a similar question" for them. If there is a mistake, select "Ignore". This can improve the ability of machine learning.
![img](https://iask.qq.com/static/docs/images/study_2.png)
### Learn unknown questions
Unknown questions are questions to which no answers can be found in the knowledge base. It is recommended to add them as new questions to supplement the knowledge base and improve the ability of machine learning.
![img](https://iask.qq.com/static/docs/images/study_3.png)

### Learn unsatisfactory questions
If the customer rates an answer as unsatisfactory, the question and the corresponding answer will appear in the unsatisfactory question learning tab, and it is recommended to correct the unsatisfactory answer.
![img](https://iask.qq.com/static/docs/images/study_4.png)
- **Approve**: Add the question as a similar question for a standard question matched by the algorithm.
- **Associate with another question**: Add the question as a similar question for a standard question already in the knowledge base.
- **Add as a new question**: Add the question as a new standard question.
- **Ignore**: Delete the question learning record.
- **Correct the answer**: Go to the edit page of the knowledge point and modify the answer or question.

## Bot Settings
In **System Management** > **Bot Settings**, you can set basic bot information, chitchat function, bot conversation reply template and trending questions. **This can be used only by admins.**

### Basic settings
Different greetings and templates for unknown and alternative questions can be set for different platforms (WeChat Official Account, WeChat Mini Program, desktop websites and mobile website). Rich text answers can be added to conversations. **In bot mode, customer inquiries only support text but not other formats.**

**Greeting (unavailable for the WeChat Official Account channel)**: When the customers opens the conversation window, they will receive the greeting message from the bot before sending the first message.
**Reply to unknown questions**: This is the reply sent by the system when the bot cannot recognize the customer's intent or match an answer or similar questions.
![img](https://iask.qq.com/static/docs/images/setting_base_2.png)
**Replies to alternative questions**: This is to probe the customer. When the customer question is not clear or the bot cannot fully recognize the customer's intent, the system will return a list of probing questions (1-5 questions can be configured).
![img](https://iask.qq.com/static/docs/images/setting_base_3.png)

### Trending questions
Trending questions are the questions most frequently asked by customers. This is an important function, and proper configuration of it can greatly improve the answer efficiency of the bot. Trending questions are supported for desktop websites, mobile websites, WeChat Mini Programs WeChat Official Accounts.
- When the customer accesses the service via a desktop or mobile website, the system will actively push the trending questions to the customer after greeting. If the customer questions are meaningless or unclear and cannot be recognized, the system may also trigger trending questions to guide the customer to select an appropriate question or probe the customer, which can improve the efficiency of communication between the customer and the bot.
- When the customer accesses the service via a WeChat Official Account, trending questions will be triggered only if the customer questions is meaningless or unclear and cannot be recognized.
