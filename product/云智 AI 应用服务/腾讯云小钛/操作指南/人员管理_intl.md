To manage accounts, roles and groups, visit **System Management** > **People Management**.
Super admins and admins can add customer service agents, assign permissions and set up groups in people management to jointly use the system. Confirm there are available agent roles before adding an agent. If there are no available agent roles, [purchase a bot](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/ticsr) first.

## Account Management              
In **System Management** > **People Management**, select the **Account Management** tab and click **Add** in the upper left corner to add a new user.
                      
> The account registered at the official website is a super admin account by default (which cannot be deleted). After login, you can create admins and agents (the default account and password will be sent to you via email and can be used directly for login). When adding a new agent, you need to enter the name, email, employee number, role and agent group information.

Roles are divided into admins and agents by default. You can also configure the permissions of a role based on your own needs.

- **Admin** has all the permissions.  Therefore, be cautious when adding an admin. Knowledge points added by an admin will be effective immediately and used without review.
- **Agent** can only use the knowledge base and agent workbench functions. Knowledge points added by an agent will be placed in "Pending tasks" and will be visible in the knowledge base only after approval by an admin (items to be reviewed include professional Q&As, chitchat, synonyms and batch import). The addition of similar questions and editing of the knowledge base are not subject to review and can take effect directly.

## Role Management

The system divides roles into admins and agents with different permissions by default. An agent can only use the knowledge base function, while an admin has full permissions for the knowledge base and system settings. As an admin has higher level of permissions, please be cautious when adding one

#### Add a new role

In **System Management** > **People Management**, click **Add** on the **Role Management** tab to add a new role and assign permissions.
