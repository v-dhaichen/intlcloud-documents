Search results for millions of faces can be returned in just a few seconds.

You can apply the SDK license for your devices (specify the number of devices allowed to use the SDK) or Android application on the Tencent Cloud Console.
- [Face Detection and Analysis](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/32800) has the following added features: face attributes such as hairstyle and mask, face quality assessment (to determine whether the quality of the face image is good enough for face recognition).
