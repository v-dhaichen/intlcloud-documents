## Overview
Powered by Tencent YouTu's world-leading facial analysis technology, Tencent Cloud Face Recognition features facial detection and analysis, feature localization, search, comparison, verification, and face liveness detection. It can be accessed via APIs and offline SDKs. It is well-suited for a variety of use cases including smart retailing and smart building, meeting facial recognition and customer identity verification demands from different industries.

## Features
Face Recognition provides the following facial recognition services.

#### Face Detection and Analysis
Face Recognition can analyze an image and determine if the image contains a face, and return the position, attributes and quality if it contains a face. Information returned include gender, age, expression, attractiveness, glasses, hair, mask, posture and quality scores. For more information, see [Face Detection and Analysis](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/32800).

#### Facial Feature Localization
Face Recognition can perform facial feature localization on a given image and calculate the 90 facial key points, including eyebrows (8 points on the left and 8 on the right), eyes (8 points on the left and 8 on the right), nose (13 points), mouth (22 points), face contour (21 points), and eyeball or pupil (2 points). For more information, see [Facial Feature Localization](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/32779).

#### Face Comparison
Face Recognition can calculate the similarity of faces in two images and return a similarity score. For more information, see [Face Comparison](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/32802).
- If you need to verify the identity of a person, eg, face login, we recommend [Face Verification](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/32806). 
- If you need to determine the specific identity of a person, eg. matching facial images against identify cards, we recommend [FaceID](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/faceid).

#### Group Management (Formerly Known as Individual Information Management)
You can create groups storing information such as facial features and IDs for [Face Verification](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/32806) and [Face Search](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/32798). For more information, see [Group Management API](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/32780).


#### Face Verification
Face Recognition can determine whether a given facial image and a given PersonID belongs to the same person. For more information about PersonID, see APIs related to Group Management. See [Face Verification](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/32806) for additional details.
Face comparison is used to determine the similarity of two faces. Unlike the [face comparison](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/32802) API, face verification is used to determine whether the person in the image is someone specified. The specific person's information is stored in the group and he or she may have multiple face images. 

#### Face Search (Formerly Known as Face Retrieval)
Face Recognition can identify similar people in one or multiple groups for a given image and rank their similarity in a descending order. It supports up to one million faces in one single search. Additionally, it can search for one or more faces in one single image. For more information, see [Face Search]( https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/32798).

#### Image-based Liveness Detection
Face Recognition can detect the liveness of a user with a user-uploaded image. Its difference from video-based liveness detection lies in that the user does not need to speak, move, or wink for detection. This feature should be only used for use cases with low attack defense requirements. For more information, see [Image-based Liveness Detection](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/32804).
