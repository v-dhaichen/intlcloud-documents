**What are core nodes and elastic compute nodes?**
A core node includes the storage and computation engines, which can be manually or scaled up but not down.
An elastic compute node only includes the computation engine, which can be manually or automatically scaled up or down elastically based on the load.

**Do I have to configure Hadoop and Spark parameters?**
No. Tencent Cloud provides the best practices for Hadoop and Spark parameter configuration for each cluster, making the clusters fully-managed and OPS-free.
