## Downloading the Demo

1. The demo project can be downloaded [here](http://ixg.qq.com/ctr_index/download) in the TPNS SDK documentation.

2. Register a test app at TPNS' website. The app name can be anything, but the package name must be com.qq.xgdemo. Then, get the AccessID and Accesskey of the registered app.

2. Import the demo project in the SDK to the corresponding development tool. Modify the node in the project where TPNS ID and key are configured.

**[AndroidStudioDemo]**

Configure the ACCESSID and ACCESSKEY obtained by registering the test app to the ```manifestPlaceholders``` node in the ```build.gradle``` file under the app module in the demo project. See the figure below:
