## What Is Cloud Infinite?

Cloud Infinite (CI) is a professional integrated image solution provided by Tencent Cloud, covering image upload, download, storage, processing and recognition and opening up Qzone's decade of image service experience to developers. At present, it has many functions such as image processing, original image protection, cross-region access setting and style preset.
## Features
### 1. Basic Image Processing
The image upload and storage services of CI are based on Cloud Object Storage (COS), which allows you to manage files through the upload and processing APIs of COS. In addition, CI also provides a variety of image processing functions, including intelligent cropping, lossless compression, watermarking and format conversion.
### 2. Image Management
**Original image protection**
Are you worried that your images get stolen by other individuals or organizations for unauthorized use?
CI has an original image protection function which, once enabled, makes images only accessible through URLs with style names, so your image resources are protected by your unique tags.

**Data source settings**
The data source setting function of CI can help you seamlessly migrate content on real servers to COS without introducing access interruption.

### 3. Domain Name Management
The domain name management function of CI enables you to choose whether to enable CDN acceleration, set custom domain names and prevent unauthorized traffic usage by setting hotlink prevention.

## Use Cases
CI can be used for all apps and websites that involve images, such as:

**Social networking**
For social networking applications with a large number of user-uploaded images, the image processing function of CI can provide convenient services such as cropping, compression and watermarking to meet the needs in various business scenarios.

**Ecommerce**
For ecommerce applications, the image content recognition function of CI can automatically review the images uploaded by merchants to determine whether the image content violates industry specifications.

**Gaming**
For gaming applications, in scenarios where the users upload custom profile photos, CI can identify in real time whether the uploaded photos are compliant and process the photos such as cropping and compression.

**Finance**
For finance applications, various image processing functions of CI can be used to accurately recognize key information in ID documents, improving the efficiency of identity verification. CI can also authenticate users with real name.

**Logistics**
Logistics plays a vital role in the rapid development of ecommerce. Traditionally, waybills are recognized manually, which is costly and inefficient. The intelligent waybill recognition service of CI can quickly and accurately recognize the sender and recipient information on waybills, greatly improving the efficiency of shipment information entry and transfer.
With such a complete image solution, developers can quickly provide image services and adjust resources to adapt to sudden changes in businesses based on the flexible scheduling capabilities of cloud services.
