In API Frontend Configuration, you can configure the API frontend information, such as the API request method and API parameters.
Configuration instructions:
(1) Configure the path to be opened, such as `/path`. If parameters need to be carried in the path, use the "{parameter name}" method, such as `/path/{key}`.

(2) Select your request method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE or HEAD.

(3) If "No Authentication" is selected, the API gateway will pass the authentication and the bound usage plan will also take effect when receiving an anonymous request.

(4) Enter remarks (optional).

(5) Enter the input configuration of your API according to the prompt.
