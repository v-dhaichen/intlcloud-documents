### Arrear Isolation Policy

Service will stop in 24 hours when your account is in arrears. You will get SMS/email notifications to top up your account within 24 hours. Your service will not be affected if you top up your account within 24 hours. 

If you do not top up your account within 24 hours, instance will be stopped and **isolated**, and billing of used CKafka instances will be stopped. Instance-related configuration data will be kept for 7 days. If your balance is positive, service will automatically resume. If your balance remains negative more than 7 days, it will be taken that you no longer wish to continue the service and relevant configuration data will be deleted permanently.

Tencent Cloud will send you notifications via SMS/email one day before deletion. Once deleted, relevant configuration data cannot be recovered.
