**4. USE OF SERVICES**

 (a)  <u>Accounts and Registration</u>. When you register for a Tencent Cloud account ("**Account**"), you may be required to provide us with some information, such as your name, postal address, email address, or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. We may deny you the right to create an account.

 (b) <u>End Users and Access</u>. Any entities or individuals that access the Services under your Account or an Application are referred to in these Terms as “**End** **Users**.” You and your authorized End Users may access and use the purchased Services in accordance with these Terms during the Term. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your Account or the password for your Account, you will notify Tencent as promptly as possible. If you are an entity, organization, or company, you will permit only your employees and contractors to access the Services through your Account. You are responsible for safeguarding any and all Account details and access credentials. Any breach of these Terms or any use of your Account by anyone to whom you disclose your username or password will be treated as if the breach or use had been carried out by you, and will not relieve you of your obligations to us. Tencent may provide downloadable tools, software development kits, sample code, or other computer software in connection with the Services or with the use of your Account (“**Software**”). You may use any Software provided by Tencent in connection with these Terms during the Term and solely in connection with the Services provided under these Terms.

 (c)  <u>Service Regions</u>. Certain Services allow you to select a geographically defined service region in which User Data is stored in order to provide the Services (a "**Service Region**"). Where a Service Region applies, Tencent will, upon your request, store User Data in the Service Region you select when User Data is being used for the provision of those Services. If your selected Service Region is the PRC, then the PRC Service Region Terms below apply with respect to those Services for which the PRC is the selected Service Region.

 (d) <u>Suspension of Services</u>. If you become aware that any Application (including an End User’s use of an Application) or User Data violates these Terms, including the Additional Terms, you will immediately suspend the Application, remove the User Data, and suspend access by the End User, as applicable. If you fail to do so within twenty-four hours after Tencent sends notice of any violation, Tencent may suspend or disable the Application and disable your Account until that violation is corrected. In the event that Tencent determines that a violation could: (a) disrupt the Services; (b) disrupt use of the Services by a third party; (c) disrupt the Tencent network or servers used to provide the Services; or (d) allow unauthorized third party access to the Services, then Tencent or its Affiliates may immediately without prior notice to you, suspend your Account or the offending Application or End User account, to the minimum extent required to prevent or resolve that violation. "**Affiliate**" means any entity that directly or indirectly Controls, is Controlled by, or is under common Control with a party, where “Control” means control of greater than fifty percent of the voting rights or equity interests of a party or by way of contract, management agreement, voting trust, or otherwise.

 (e) <u>Service Modifications</u>. Tencent may discontinue or make any changes to the Services at any time.  If Tencent discontinues or makes any changes to the Services that would materially decrease the functionality of those Services, Tencent will use commercially reasonable efforts to inform you of the change with reasonable advance notice before it goes into effect, provided that you have subscribed to be informed about those changes. Tencent may make the change, and will not be obligated to provide notice, if the discontinuation or change is necessary to address an emergency or threat to the security or integrity of the Services, comply with or respond to litigation, address Intellectual Property Rights concerns, or comply with the law or government requests. Tencent may provide periodic updates to the Software or Services provided by Tencent from time to time (“**Updates**”). Tencent may also make new features or functionality available from time to time through the Services and add new services to the Services from time to time (by adding them at the URL set forth under that definition), the use of which may be contingent upon your agreement to additional requirements.

 (f) <u>Security and Privacy</u>. Tencent’s security and privacy practices are available in the Additional Terms. You shall configure and use the Services in a way that meets your security requirements.

 (g) <u>Third Party Applications</u>. You are solely responsible for any software used by you in connection with your use of the Services ("**Third Party Software**"), including third party software made available in connection with the Services. Tencent is not responsible for and is not liable for any damages or losses arising from the use of the Third Party Software, and Tencent does not endorse, support or guarantee the quality, reliability, or suitability of any Third Party Software. You will comply with any terms and conditions applicable to Third Party Software. Tencent does not provide any technical support for any Third Party Software. Please contact the relevant supplying third party for technical support. 

 (h) <u>Access to Your Device</u>. In order for Tencent to provide the Services, Tencent may require access to and use of a device you own or control. For example, Tencent may need to access a device's processor and storage to complete a Software installation. Tencent will provide further information regarding how Tencent Cloud accesses the device within Tencent Cloud. You agree to give Tencent access to the device for these purposes, and you acknowledge that if you do not provide access, Tencent may not be able to provide the Services (or certain features within the Services). You agree that Tencent may use or access Personal Information (as defined in Tencent’s Privacy Policy) within the device in the course of providing Tencent Cloud, and that any Personal Information will be treated in accordance with Tencent’s Privacy Policy.

 **5. FEES AND PAYMENTS**

You agree that you are solely responsible for payment of all Fees and all taxes associated with any such payments. All payments made by you shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any tax. To the extent that you are required by applicable law to make such a deduction or withholding of tax, you shall provide us with an official tax receipt or other appropriate supporting documentation within 30 days after payment of the deduction or withholding tax and increase the amount paid to us to the extent necessary to ensure that we receive a sum equal to the amount we would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.

Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TENCENT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

The Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to the Terms. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.   

 (c) Tencent will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. The arbitration tribunal will consist of three arbitrators to be appointed in accordance with the Rules. Arbitration will be conducted in English. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

 (d) YOU AND TENCENT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
