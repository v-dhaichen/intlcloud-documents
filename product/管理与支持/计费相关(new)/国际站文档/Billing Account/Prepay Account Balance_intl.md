# What is prepay account balance?
Your prepay account balance reflects your remaining cash balance and remaining free credits. The service automatically charges the prepay account balance at the end of a billing cycle. The billing cycle varies by product. Tencent Cloud services are billed either by the hour, by the day or by the month.

# What happens when the prepay account balance is negative?
When your prepay account balance is negative, it is very likely that your cloud services will be interrupted. Most of our hourly billed products will be suspended if your account remains negative for consecutive two hours. Therefore, to ensure a better user experience, if your prepay account balance is less than your service fee, we will automatically charge you using your designated credit card or PayPal account. We will also automatically top up your prepay account once your prepay account balance is less than $1. Generally, the top up amount will be no more than $30. For example, if you owe $3 at the end of a billing cycle, we will charge you $3 and top up your prepay account balance to $30.

If your prepay account balance remains negative and we are unable to charge you using credit card or PayPal, your cloud services will be interrupted. Please ensure that your credit card is valid to prevent this from happening.

If the top up amount is larger than the amount you currently owe, your next payment will be reduced accordingly. 

# How do I top up my prepay account balance？
Please refer to the page “Prepay Account Top Up".

# How do I withdraw from my account balance？
You can submit a ticket for your cash account balance to be returned to your payment source. Please note that only your cash balance can be withdrawn. The withdrawn amount will return to your original payment source, which will be your PayPal account in most cases. It will normally take about 3-5 business days for the withdrawal process to complete.

Please note that only cash balance can be withdrawn, credit balance (free credits or service credits granted by Tencent Cloud) cannot be withdrawn.
