Users need to top-up their prepay account to purchase Tencent Cloud services if their prepay account is in negative. To avoid service interruptions caused by arrears, we suggest that users top up their prepay account before using any cloud services. Please note that most Tencent Cloud services are billed by hour, therefore prepay account arrears may cause service suspension.

To top-up their prepay account, users can choose to pay with Credit Card or Bank Transfers.

## Automatic Top-up

Most of our cloud services are billed by the hour and therefore your account will be automatically charged by the hour. When your account balance runs negative, it is very likely that your cloud services will be interrupted. We strongly suggest that you top-up before purchasing any services. To ensure a better user experience, we will automatically top-up your Tencent Cloud account when your account balance runs less than $1. If the top-up amount is larger than the amount you currently owe, we will automatically reduce the next charge accordingly. 

### How does automatic charge and top-up work?

The timing of when we automatically charge your account depends on the cloud services you use. Most of our cloud services are billed by the hour, meaning your account will be automatically charged by the hour. If your account balance is less than $1, we will automatically top-up your account until your account balance is $30.  

For example, if your account balance is $2 and you spent $3 on services in the recent billing cycle, we will charge you $3 and top-up your account balance to $30 automatically. If your account balance is $3.5 and you spent $3 on services in the recent billing cycle, we will top-up your account balance to $29.5 automatically. In either case, your final account balance will be $30.

If we unable to top-up your prepay account and your prepay account balance remains negative, cloud services for most products will be interrupted within two hours. Please ensure that your credit card is valid and functioning.
