Tencent Cloud International website has launched a Beneficiary Account Bank Transfer feature. Customers can apply for a unique Tencent Cloud Bank Transfer account to associate with their own account. The system will verify if the registered name in the console matches the bank account name. If the names matches, the system will automatically top up the account and send a report to the finance system. To enable Bank Transfer, go to: Billing Center>Payment Management>Payment>[Bank Transfer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/recharge).

**Step 1. Set a payer name for the Bank Transfer account**
Click **Add Account Name** to add the payer’s bank account name. Up to 5 payer bank account names can be added. The name must be the same as the actual payer’s bank account name, or you will not be able to top up the account.
