There are three ways for you to make a payment in your post-paid billing account.

- Your cloud services are billed based on your billing cycle, and we will automatically charge the bill amount on your default payment method bound with your post-paid account on the due date (10th of each month).

  For example, your credit limit is $30 and your billing cycle is 30 days, and you spent $20 on cloud services during August, during which your available credit is deducted to $10. We will automatically charge $20 on your default payment method on September, 10th, after which your available credit will be restored to $30.

- When the available credit in your post-paid billing account is equal to 0 or less than the bill amount before the due date, we will automatically charge the bill amount on your default payment method bound with your post-paid account. Once the bill is successfully paid, your available credit will be restored.

- If your account is in arrears and your cloud services are interrupted, you can make a payment on the billing center by yourself in the following ways:

  A. After logging in to Tencent Cloud, you can click "**Pay Now**" on the "**Billing Center**" page to pay off the outstanding balance in your account if there are funds in your account, but you cannot make a payment here if the outstanding balance is equal to 0.

  B. The other self-help option is that you make a payment with the credit card you have added in the account after processing to the "**Payment**" page. If the payment amount is larger than the amount you currently owe, the surplus amount will be added to the available credit which cannot be withdrawn.
