The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has established a set of best practices for securely storing, processing and delivering protected media and content. These best practices are designed to inform application and cloud service providers collaborating with MPAA members the content security requirements. Media companies use these best practices to assess risk and security of their content. Tencent Cloud ensures that its management of customer content is in compliance with the MPAA Content Security Model through self-assessment.

The components of the model are based on the relevant ISO standards (27001-27002), security standards (i.e. NIST, CSA, ISACA, and SANS), and industry best practices. Among them, ISO27001, ISO27017, ISO27018, PCI DSS and CSA STAR are key compliance programs of Tencent Cloud for which it has passed third-party audits.

### Overview of MPAA Standards

MPAA\'s best practice standards, including *Content Security Best Practices - Common Guidelines* and *Content Security Best Practices - Application and Cloud/Distributed Environment Security Guidelines*, provide guidance on the best practice controls and implementation steps.
