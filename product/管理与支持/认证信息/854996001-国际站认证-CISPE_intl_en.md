### What Is GDPR?

The European Union\'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is regarded as the most stringent data protection regulation in history because of its strict protection of personal data and severe penalties for non-compliance. It took effect on May 25, 2018. Since then, companies that have data interactions with users in the EU must be certified for compliance before they can operate.

### What Is CISPE?

Committed to serving millions of customers in Europe, the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) is the only non-profit organization in the EU that provides Data Protection Code of Conduct certification services to cloud service providers. CISPE\'s Code of Conduct for data protection anticipates the enforcement of the European Union\'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The code aligns with the strict requirements laid out in the GDPR framework to help cloud infrastructure providers comply and so avoid penalties while also offering a framework to help customers and end users to select cloud providers and trust their services.

The CISPE Code of Conduct :

 -  Gives a framework to comply with the GDPR
 -  Excludes the reuse of our customers' data
 -  Allows you to process and store your data exclusively in the EU
 -  Identifies which Cloud Infrastructure Services are suitable for the data processing that you wish to perform
 -  Helps citizens regain control over their data

In light of new EU regulations, the cloud infrastructure services currently provided by Tencent Cloud have been certified for compliance with the CISPE Code of Conduct.
