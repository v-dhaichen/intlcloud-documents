## Events
The player can perform event listening through the objects returned by the initialization, for example:
```
var player = TCPlayer('player-container-id', options);
player.on(type, function);
```
Here, type is the event type. Supported events include:

| Name | Description |  
|------------|---------------------------------|
| play| Playback has started. This is triggered when the play() method is called or autoplay is set to true and takes effect. At this time, the paused attribute is false |  
| playing | Triggered when the playback is paused due to buffering or resumed after pause. The paused attribute is false. Usually, this event is used to mark that the video has actually started playing, as the play event just starts the playback but the image has not started rendering |  
| loadstart | Triggered when data loading starts |  
| durationchange | Triggered when the duration data of the video changes |  
| loadedmetadata | Metadata for the loaded video |  
| loadeddata | This event is triggered when the data of the current frame is loaded but there is not enough data to play the next frame of the video |  
| progress | Triggered when the media data is obtained |  
| canplay | Trigger when the player is able to start playing the video |  
| canplaythrough | Triggered when the player is expected to be able to continue playing the specified video without buffering |
| error | Triggered when an error occurs in video playback |  
| pause | Triggered on pause |  
| ratechange | Triggered when the playback speed changes |  
| seeked | Triggered at the end of the seeking for the specified playback position |  
| seeking | Trigger when seeking for the specified playback position |  
| timeupdate | The current playback position has changed, which can be understood as currentTime has changed |  
| volumechange | Triggered when the volume is set or the value of the muted attribute changes |  
| waiting | Triggered when the playback is paused and the next frame of content is unavailable |  
| ended | Triggered when the video has finished playing. At this time, the currentTime value is equal to the maximum value of the media resource |  
| resolutionswitching | Definition switching in progress |  
| resolutionswitched | Definition switched |  
| fullscreenchange | Triggered when full screen mode is switched |
