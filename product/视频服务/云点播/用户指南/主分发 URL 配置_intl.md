## Operation Scenario
After a domain name is successfully added and resolved, you can access your video resources through the new domain name; however, for the URL of the video obtained via the API or in the console, the Host remains the original domain name. In order to update the Host information, you need to log in to the [VOD Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/video/cdnlog) to set the primary distribution URL.
## Steps
1. Log in to [VOD Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/video/cdnlog) and select **Distribution and Playback** > **Primary Distribution URL** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Edit** on the right of the configuration information to set the following parameters:
 - Supported protocol types for primary distribution: HTTP and HTTPS.
 - Primary distribution domain name: The default domain name is `xxx.vod2.myqcloud.com` that is auto-assigned by the system. You can also [add]() and [resolve]() a custom domain name as the primary distribution domain name.
