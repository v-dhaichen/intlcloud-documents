- No access logs will be generated for the day on which there is no request received, and you will see "No data".
- By default, the CDN logs the requests on an hourly basis. That is, there can be up to 24 log files logged per day. No logs will be generated for the hour in which there is no request received.
- CDN logs can be delayed by approximately 30 mins.

## Note

Because the bandwidth/traffic consumed by TCP packet loss, three-way handshake, and retransmission etc. on the application layer is less than that on the transport layer, the bandwidth/traffic data recorded in the logs is the data of the packets return on the application layer (HTTP protocol).
