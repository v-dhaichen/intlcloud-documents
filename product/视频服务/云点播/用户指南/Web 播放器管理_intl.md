With the web player management feature, you can easily customize the style of the video player provided by Tencent Cloud and then embed the player code in your webpage to display the custom style.

## Managing a Player

Log in to [VOD Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/video), and click **Distribution and Playback** > **Web Player** in the left sidebar to open the **Web Player** page. You can see a player list that manages all the players. You can create and maintain up to 10 custom players. One of them (the initial player) is set as the default player. When all video files are published, unless otherwise specified, the default player settings will be applied to the web player code window to generate the playback code.
