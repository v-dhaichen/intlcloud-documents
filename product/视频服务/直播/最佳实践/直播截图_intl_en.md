The LVB screencapturing feature takes screenshots of a real-time live stream at regular intervals and generates images. You can get the screenshot information through the callback notification. The screenshots can be used in various scenarios such as LVB porn detection and live room cover generation.

## LVB Screencapturing Flow

Overall process:
1. Configure the LVB screencapturing feature in the console or through TencentCloud API.
- Start an LVB push.
- The screencapturing service generates screenshot data according to the configuration and stores it in COS.
- Information about the generated screenshot is returned in a callback.

## LVB Screencapturing Configuration

### Screencapturing Configuration Method
- TencentCloud API
- **LVB Console** > **[Screencapturing and Porn Detection Configuration](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/config/jtjh)**

### Screencapturing Interval Configuration

You can specify the screencapturing frequency based on your business needs, i.e., the screencapturing interval (SnapshotInterval) in a range of 5-300 seconds with a default interval of 10 seconds.

### Screenshot Width and Height Configuration

The screencapturing service supports taking screenshots by the specified width and height:

>! If you do not need to specify the width and height, the default screenshot width and height (set to 0) are the width and height of the pushed video stream, and you can ignore the advanced configuration below and skip to the next section.

First, look at the following three concepts of width and height:

- Push width and height, i.e., the width and height of the live streaming video, which are set to (X, Y) in this document.
- Configured width and height, i.e., the width and height configured in the console/through the TencentCloud API, which are set to (W, H) in this document.
- Screenshot width and height, i.e., the width and height of the screenshot generated by the screencapturing service, which are set to (N, M) in this document.

The screencapturing service supports the following configurations:

- If the width and height are not set, then the (W, H) = (0, 0) is used by default. At this time, the screenshot width and height are the same as the push width and height, i.e., (N, M) = (X, Y).
- If only the width W is set, then the screenshot width N = W, and the screenshot height is scaled proportionally, i.e., M = N / X \* Y.
- If only the height H is set, then the screenshot height M = H, and the screenshot width is scaled proportionally, i.e., N = M / Y \* X.
- If (W, H) are set at the same time, then the screenshot width and height are the same as the configured width and height, i.e., (N, M) = (W, H).

The automatic swap of configured width and height is suitable for the following scenario:

- If W is set to be smaller than H, both W and H are greater than 0, and X is set to be greater than Y during the push, then the configured width is smaller than the height, but the push width is greater than the height.

In this case, if a screenshot is directly taken, it will be distorted. In order to avoid the distortion, the backend of the LVB screencapturing service will automatically swap the values of W and H to ensure that the configured aspect ratio is consistent with that of the live stream.


## Event Message Notification for LVB Screencapturing

For event message notification configuration, see [Event Message Notification](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/32744). The screencapturing callback notification is sent to the pre-configured receiving server through the HTTP POST protocol in JSON format.

### Screencapturing Callback Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| event\_type | int | Callback information type, which is always 200 for screencapturing callback |
| stream\_id | string | Stream name |
| channel\_id | string | Same as the stream name |
| create\_time | int64 | UNIX timestamp when the screenshot is generated |
| file\_size | int | Screenshot file size in bytes |
| width | int | Screenshot width in pixels |
| height | int | Screenshot height in pixels |
| pic\_url | string | Screenshot file path /path/name.jpg. For more information, see **Field Details** below |
| pic\_full\_url | string | Full screenshot URL. For more information, see **Field Details** below |
| sign | string | Callback signature. For more information, see **Event Message Notification** |
| t | int64 | Callback signature expiration time (UNIX timestamp). For more information, see **Event Message Notification** |

### Field Details
- `pic_url` details:
 - path: Year-month-day
 - name: Live stream name-screenshot-hour-minute-second-widthxheight.jpg
 Example:
```
 /2018-12-17/stream_name-screenshot-19-06-59-640x352.jpg
```
This field can be used to splice a custom COS CDN domain name. If you do not need a CDN domain name, use pic_full_url directly.

- `pic_full_url` details:
 - http://COS domain name+pic_url
	Example:
```
	http://testbucket-1234567890.cos.region.myqcloud.com/2018-12-17/stream_name-screenshot-19-06-59-640x352.jpg
```
