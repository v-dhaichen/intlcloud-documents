In recent years, with the gradual maturity of the underlying audio and video technologies, the live broadcasting industry has seen explosive growth around the world, and it has been a trend for Chinese internet companies to march into the global market. The globalization experience of Chinese companies in various service sectors serves as a solid basis for Chinese live broadcasting platforms to go abroad. Many leading platforms are carrying out product globalization plans in order to gain a wider competitive edge, and some small platforms are also finding a way out in overseas markets due to their inability to stand out amongst the fierce competition in China. Meanwhile, foreign platforms are also in a dogfight. Although YouTube, Periscope, and Facebook, the three giants, are almost monopolies, there are still vast markets that have not been well-developed and can be penetrated by small- and medium-sized platforms. Based on this, Tencent Cloud continues widening its resource reserve in global live broadcasting and improving the live broadcast acceleration performance to help Chinese platforms win international markets.

In addition to push and playback, the complete LVB service should also include authentication, transcoding, screencapturing, recording, callback, porn detection, DRM, and other features. The figure below shows the basic feature modules of Tencent Cloud's Global LVB solution.

From the perspective of basic functionality, the requirements of global live broadcasting are generally the same as those of domestic live broadcasting. However, there are more challenges overseas mainly due to the wider geographical area, more complicated network environments, and lower cross-border network quality. In order to reduce the latency and lag and improve service stability and reliability, Tencent Cloud has optimized the LVB service at the **architecture, network, security, and resource** levels for global live broadcasting scenarios.

### Deployment of Multiple Central Nodes
**Tencent Cloud has built a lot of central IDCs in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Germany, Toronto, Silicon Valley, Russia, South Africa, and South Korea and continues expanding into more countries and regions.** Hosting all the modules needed for global live broadcasting. the central IDCs are deployed in a distributed manner with a decentralized architecture to better server global end users and guarantee fast failover upon any IDC exceptions. Taking into account the impact of low cross-border network quality and stability on live broadcast latency and lag, all the overseas central nodes are interconnected through Direct Connect, and the domestic central nodes are interconnected with the overseas ones through Direct Connect lines too with the Hong Kong node as a relay. The overall architecture is as shown below:

To intuitively demonstrate the acceleration performance of overseas central nodes, we compare the statistics of Chinese end users watching videos of hosts in the US. As you can see in the figure below, acceleration via Direct Connect keeps the lag rate low and the network stable.

### Acceleration in Edge Regions
Central nodes can perfectly meet the needs of local end users, but the needs of those in non-central countries and regions should be catered for too. Due to various restrictions, no central nodes have been built there, and thus cache nodes are required. Such countries and regions are called edge regions, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, the Middle East, India, Africa, and South America, where the cross-border network quality is relatively low, and the lagging rate of cross-region pull is quite high. For these edge regions, Tencent Cloud sets priorities for service modules. It gives high priority to ensuring that valid local users can watch live streams without the need of cross-border transmission of local data. Services of other modules are re-pulled from edge servers to central nodes and finally implemented on central nodes. **As you can see in the figure below, after local node acceleration is enabled in an edge region, the lagging rate is significantly reduced, and the acceleration performance is much higher than that of other service providers in the industry.**

### Optimal Access and Failover
Similar to the case of Mainland China, there are multiple ISPs in one overseas region, such as Thailand's DTAC, AIS, and TURE, Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan Mobile, and so-net, as well as Indonesia's Telkomsel, XL, and INDOSAT, and cross-ISP access speed is subject to bandwidth and resources. To improve the access experience of end users on networks operated by different ISPs, Tencent Cloud's scheduling system allows them to access their own ISPs. Plus, its cache nodes built locally generally boast BGP lines for access and peering links with local ISPs.
For example, for end users of three ISPs (DTAC, AIS, and TURE) in Thailand, the central scheduling system collects a large amount of foreign IPs and ISP information and automatically schedules them to the nearest CDN nodes based on their IPs, with a recognition accuracy of over **99.5%**. Switching between data centers upon exception is also supported. If the monitoring and detecting nodes find an exception in a region, the system will automatically select the optimal data center to switch to.

### Network Transmission Optimization
When live streams are transmitted on overseas networks, the traditional TCP transmission method cannot guarantee low transmission latency. Due to the long distance of overseas transmission, limitations of international egress bandwidth, and frequent network quality fluctuations, TCP is not suitable for overseas data transmission as it is more time-consuming to be upgraded and optimized and has a higher packet loss rate. Tencent Cloud uses Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) to improve the reliability of data transmission on overseas networks. Upper-layer data proxy acceleration with QUIC is implemented at the application layer, which means that appropriate adjustments to parameters or congestion algorithms can take effect immediately to efficiently fix high latency and high packet loss rate, avoid congestions, and reduce the round-trip time (RTT). **Tests with actual data show that Tencent Cloud's optimized scheme reduces the connection time by 40% and the lagging rate by 20% on average compared to the traditional TCP scheme.**

The figure below shows a comparison of lags for global viewers watching a live stream pushed by a host in UAE to the UAE cache node. You can see that the lags remain low when the stream is accelerated via QUIC.

### Massive resource reserve
In addition to technical architectures and solutions, resource reserves are critical to live broadcasting services too. If there are no overseas resources used as the underlying support, all technologies are merely theories. As mentioned in the Tencent Cloud global node distribution chart at the beginning of this document, **relying on its globalization strategy and long-term investment in overseas markets, Tencent Cloud has built more than 1,300 transmission nodes in over 50 countries and regions, with a total bandwidth of 100+ Tbps across 50+ global ISP partners. Plus, it has more than 200 overseas cache nodes.** In addition, Tencent Cloud always cooperates with multiple ISPs in the same region, with at least 3 copies of disaster recovery backup data available in each egress to ensure service stability and reliability.
