**Please do not purchase the Service unless and until you have fully read, and completely understood and accepted all the terms hereof. By clicking "Agree"/ "Next", or by purchasing or using the Service, or by otherwise accepting this Agreement, whether express or implied, you are deemed to have read, and agreed to be bound by, this Agreement. This Agreement shall then have legal effect on both you and Tencent Cloud, constituting a binding legal document on both parties.**

##  **1. Terms and Definitions**

1.1  **Live Video Broadcasting (LVB) Service**: is the low-latency, high-concurrency, stable and smooth audio and video broadcasting service provided by Tencent Cloud. LVB supports functions including but not limited to real-time transcoding, intelligent porn detection, screenshot and recording, and is subject to the Service you purchase and contents of the Service provided by Tencent Cloud.

1.2  **Service Period/Month**: A calendar month is counted as a Service Period. When the period concerned is less than one full calendar month, the period from the day on which a user starts to use the Service to the very last day of such month will be counted as one Service Period. For example, if one starts to use the Service on March 19, the first Service Period will be from March 19 to March 31. The availability of the Service is calculated independently for each Service Period.

1.3  **Unit of Time**: For measuring the Service, each 5 minutes will be deemed as one measurement unit, resulting in 288 measurement points each day. The measurement point of 00:00:00 represents the time slot from 00:00:00 to 00:04:59, and the rest can be deduced by analogy.

1.4  **Failure Rate of Video Playing within each Unit of Time**: the proportion of the number of failed requests of the Service due to reasons attributable to Tencent Cloud within one Unit of Time out of the total number of valid requests within such Unit of Time, i.e., Failure Rate of Video Playing within each Unit of Time = number of failed requests for video loading within one Unit of Time / total number of valid requests within such Unit of Time × 100%. A failed request refers to a valid quest with the return of a 5XX error code or a user request failure due to the unavailability of any Tencent Cloud Live Video Broadcasting node. A valid request refers to a request received by the server of the Live Video Broadcasting. However, any failure of video playing due to expiration of any anti-leech protection adopted by a user with anti-leech authentication enabled, or block of a domain name caused by any illegal or prohibited live broadcasting content or otherwise, or any anomaly on the push end, will not be deemed a valid request. If the total number of your valid requests within one Unit of Time is less than 250, service availability will not be counted for such Unit of Time. One IP will be deemed as one user, and all repeated failed requests of one IP within the measurement time period will be deemed as one failed request.

1.5  **Service Downtime within a Service Period Calculated in Minutes**: If the Failure Rate of Video Playing within each Unit of Time of the Live Video Broadcasting service is more than 0.4%, it shall be deemed that the Service is unavailable within such Unit of Time. If such situation lasts for ten (10) minutes or more, such time period shall be counted into the Service downtime. If such situation that lasts less than ten (10) minutes, it will not be counted into the Service downtime. The accumulative total of Service downtime within a Service Period is the Service Downtime within a Service Period Calculated in Minutes.

1.6  **Monthly Service Fee for a Service Month**: the service fees for LVB under a Tencent Cloud account of a client during one Service Month (including data charges by data volume or by bandwidth, and charges for transcoding, recording, screenshot, porn detection and other value-added services). 

1.7  **Total Time within a Service Month Calculated in Minutes**: the total number of days within such Service Month × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes).

##   **2. Service Availability**

###  **2.1 Calculation of Service Availability**

Service Availability = (1 - Service Downtime within a Service Period Calculated in Minutes / Total Time within a Service Period Calculated in Minutes) × 100%

### **2.2 Service Standard Indicator**

**The Service Availability of the Service** provided by Tencent Cloud will be **no less than 99.9%**.

You cannot use the voucher to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the voucher to a third party for consideration or for free.

Tencent Cloud will verify and ascertain your application upon receipt of such application. If there is any dispute over the calculation of the Service Availability for a Service Month, **both parties agree that the back-end record of Tencent Cloud will prevail**.

(2) **You should apply for such compensation no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the expiration of the applicable Service Month in which the Service Availability fails to meet the standard**.
