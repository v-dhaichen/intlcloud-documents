Tencent Cloud Live Video Broadcasting (LVB) is designed to deliver professional, stable, and swift cloud-based live streaming services. Catering for the needs of different scenarios, it offers three service editions, namely LVB, Live Camera Broadcasting (LCB), and Live Event Broadcasting (LEB) for large-scale real-time playback, high-concurrence push recording, and ultra-low latency live streaming, respectively. Together with the MLVB SDK, LVB makes a one-stop audiovisual live streaming solution.

## LVB
Relying on Tencent's well-established audiovisual platforms, Tencent Cloud's globally-deployed cache nodes, and leading AI technologies in audio and video, LVB gives you access to Tencent's core underlying capabilities of live streaming and provides you with services such as professional, stable, and swift LVB push, transcoding, delivery, and playback that fully meet the requirements for low latency, ultra-high image quality, and high performance to sustain massive volumes of concurrent requests.
You can activate LVB by logging in to the LVB Console. For more information, see [Getting Started](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/13551).


## LCB (Live Monitoring)
Live Camera Broadcasting (LCB) is a specially designed solution for scenarios where there are massive amounts of concurrent upstream audiovisual requests. Optimized for high-concurrence push and leveraging the AI-backed video technology and VOD service capability, LCB provides cloud-based services to meet the needs of such scenarios as real-time surveillance, smart security, and live streaming tours in scenic attractions.

## LEB (Ultra-low Latency Live Broadcasting)
As a lower-latency extension of LVB, Live Event Broadcasting (LEB) outperforms traditional live broadcasting protocols, providing an extraordinary millisecond-level live streaming experience for viewers.
It is ideal for scenarios with demanding latency requirements, such as online education, live sport streaming, and online quizzes.
