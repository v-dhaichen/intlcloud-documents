## Introduction
CLS consumes log topic data by Ckafka instance. This section describes how to enable Ckafka consumption for a log topic.

## Prerequisites

Tencent Cloud's Cloud Message Queue (CKafka) has been activated, and a Ckafka consumption instance and a message queue topic have been created in the same region with the log topic.

## Directions

1. Log in to the [CLS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls).
2. Click **Logset** in the left navigation pane.
3. Click the ID/name of the logset for which Ckafka consumption needs to be configured to go to its details page.
4. Locate the log topic to be consumed, and click **Configure** -> **Real-time Consumption** to go to the Ckafka consumption page.
5. Click **Edit** on the right of the page to configure Ckafka consumption.
6. Enable Ckafka consumption, and select the Ckafka instance for consumption and the relevant message queue topic.
7. Click **Save** to enable Ckafka consumption. If the status of Ckafka consumption is displayed as "Enabled", it means that it has been enabled successfully.
