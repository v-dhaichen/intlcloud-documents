## Environment Dependencies

[HADOOP-COS](https://github.com/tencentyun/hadoop-cos) and Hadoop-COS-Java-SDK (included in the dep directory of HADOOP-COS)

Druid version: Druid-0.12.1

## Download and Installation

### Obtain hadoop-cos 

Download [HADOOP-COS](https://github.com/tencentyun/hadoop-cos) from Github official platform.

### Install hadoop-cos
Druid-hdfs-extension is required if Druid uses COS for Deep Storage.
After downloading HADOOP-COS, copy hadoop-cos-2.xxjar and cos_hadoop_api-5.2.6.jar from the dep directory to extensions/druid-hdfs-storage and hadoop-dependencies/hadoop-client/2.x.x under druid's installation path.


## Directions
### Modify configuration

First, modify the file conf/druid/_common/common.runtime.properties under druid's installation path, add the extension of hdfs to druid.extensions.loadList, specify hdfs as druid's deep storage, and enter the path of cosn:

```
properties
druid.extensions.loadList=["druid-hdfs-storage"]
druid.storage.type=hdfs
druid.storage.storageDirectory=cosn://bucket-appid/<druid-path>
```

Create a hdfs configuration file hdfs-site.xml under the directory conf/druid/_common/, and enter COS's keys and other information:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="configuration.xsl"?>
