## Overview

Origin-pull settings are mainly used for live data migration and specific request redirection. For instance, if there is no user-requested object in the bucket or redirection is needed for special requests, setting origin-pull address can satisfy usersâ€™ demands.

As of July 2017, origin-pull setting supports IP from China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom and Great Wall Broadband Network. Supports for other carriers are coming soon.

## Setting up Origin-pull

1. Log in to the [COS Console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/login), and select **Bucket List** from the left side bar to access the Bucket List page. Click the bucket (such as example) where you want to configure the origin-pull and access the bucket.

2. Click **Basic Configuration** to go to the Basic Configuration page of the bucket, locate the origin-pull settings, and then click **Edit** to go into the editing mode.

> **Notes:**

- **After enabling origin-pull, be sure to enter the origin server's domain name or IP address, otherwise the settings cannot be saved.**
- **In "Origin Server Address", only enter the domain name without "http://" or IP address. You can also add the port number in the format of ":[port]".**

```
For example (the following example is for reference only):
abc.example.com
abc.example.com:8080
10.10.10.10
10.10.10.10:8080
```

- **As of July 2017, the console only supports origin-pull over HTTP. Origin-pull over HTTPS is not supported.**

## Example

**Background**
A user with APPID of 1250000000 created a bucket named "example", and enabled the CDN accelerated domain name:

```
example-1250000000.file.myqcloud.com```
Set the origin server address for the bucket to:
```

abc.example.com

```
Store the image 1.jpg at the origin server (`http://abc.example.com`).

**The first access from the client:**
```

http://example-1250000000.file.myqcloud.com/1.jpg

```
When COS finds that the object cannot be hit, it returns the HTTP status code 302 to the client and is redirected to 
```

http://abc.example.com/1.jpg

```
Then the origin server provides the object to the client to ensure the access, and COS copies 1.jpg from the origin server and saves it to the root directory of the bucket "example".

**The second access**
```

http://example-1250000000.file.myqcloud.com/1.jpg

```
COS directly hits the object 1.jpg in the root directory and returns it to the client.
```
