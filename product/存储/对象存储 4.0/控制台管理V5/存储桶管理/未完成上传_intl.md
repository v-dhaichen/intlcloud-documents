## Overview
If prompted "**Deletion failed. Delete the valid data in the bucket first.**" when deleting a bucket, you can go to the **Partially Uploaded** tab to view the files that are partially uploaded and delete them. Only after you have deleted all partially uploaded and completely uploaded files in a bucket can you delete the bucket.

## Procedure

1. Log in to the [COS Console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/login) with a Tencent Cloud account, click **Bucket List** on the left side bar, and click the bucket you want to delete to enter the bucket details page.
