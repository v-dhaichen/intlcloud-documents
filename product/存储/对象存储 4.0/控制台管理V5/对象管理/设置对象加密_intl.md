## Overview

You can encrypt the objects stored in buckets in the COS Console to prevent data leakage. For more information about encryption, see [Server-side Encryption Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/18145). The following section will guide you through how to encrypt objects.

> - COS currently supports SSE-COS for encryption.
> - Server-side encryption is currently only available in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou regions.
> - The experience accessing an encrypted object is the same as that accessing an unencrypted one, provided that you already have access to it.
> - Server-side encryption encrypts only the data but not the metadata of the object. Server-side encrypted objects can only be accessed with a valid signature but not by anonymous users.
> - When you try to list the objects in a bucket, all objects will be listed, no matter whether they are encrypted.

## Steps
