You can search for the uploaded objects and directories by prefixes in the console.

- Log in to the [COS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5) to go to the bucket of the object you want to search for. Enter the object prefix in the search box in the upper right corner of the file list to search for the object or folder under the bucket's root directory.

- The COS Console supports multi-level directory search. To search for an object in a folder, enter the full path and object prefix in the search box, or go to the folder and search for the object by its prefix.
  For example,
 to search for the object "picture.jpg" of the doc folder stored in the bucket "examplebucket", enter "doc/p" in the search box and then click the search icon to display the search result.
