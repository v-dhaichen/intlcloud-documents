## Arrears and Service Termination

COS will be stopped automatically if your account falls into arrears for 24 hours. Your data will be kept for 120 days. If your account is not topped up to a positive balance within 120 days, your data will be destroyed.

If you receive arrears reminders, go to the Top-up Center  [Top-up Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/recharge) in the console and top up your account to prevent your business from being affected.

For billing details, see the [Resource Statement](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/resources) page in the console.
