## Arrears and Service Termination

COS will be stopped automatically if your account falls into arrears for 24 hours. Your data will be kept for 120 days. If your account is not topped up to a positive balance within 120 days, your data will be destroyed.

If you receive arrears reminders, go to the [Payment Page](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/recharge) in the console and top up your available credit to prevent your business from being affected.

Go to the console to see your [Bill Details](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/resources). 

If you have any questions regarding billing items, you can refer to [COS Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6239) to learn more about billing items and rules.

You can set a balance reminder using **Account Balance Alarm** function in the **Billing Center**. For more information, see [Billing overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555).

Note:
-  If your account falls into arrears and COS service is suspended, **you will still continue to be billed for occupied storage** untill your data is destroyed.
-  Data cannot be recovered once destroyed.
-  Service will  automatically resume when your account is positive
-  You can avoid unnecessary charges by deleting data on COS that you no longer use.
