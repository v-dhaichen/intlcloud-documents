The API documentation contains a detailed API list and usage examples, which are written for those who completed initialization. It is recommended to use Command+F to find the API, check its description, and apply in your project.    

> If you need more features, or do not understand what the returned parameters mean, you are advised to view the comments in the code using three finger drag, Force-touch, or hovering over the variable and pressing Control+Command+D.

## Best Practices of Common Operations

This section describes the best practices of some common operations, which are available after you complete the initialization according to Getting Started.

### Upload a file

See the [Upload a file](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/11280#step---2-.E4.B8.8A.E4.BC.A0.E6.96.87.E4.BB.B6) section in Getting Started.

### Resume upload from breakpoint

Multipart upload is used to upload a file larger than 1 MB. That is, split the file into multiple parts with each holding a size of 1 MB, and then upload these parts (4 at most) in parallel. Resuming upload from breakpoint is implemented on the basis that the uploaded parts are stored in the backend server.    

During multipart upload, resumeData for resuming upload is generated after you initialize multipart upload or cancel the upload. This is used to generate another upload request for resuming upload. The following example shows how to get ResumeData:

```objective-C
QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest* put = [QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest new];
//···Set some parameters for upload
put.initMultipleUploadFinishBlock = ^(QCloudInitiateMultipartUploadResult * multipleUploadInitResult, QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectResumeData resumeData) {
	//Call back the block after you initialize multipart upload, in which you can obtain resumeData for generating a multipart upload request
	QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest* request = [QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest requestWithRequestData:resumeData];
};

[[QCloudCOSTransferMangerService defaultCOSTransferManager] UploadObject:put];

//···When initialization is completed and upload is not completed
NSError* error;
//The following shows how resumeData is generated after the user cancels the upload
resumeData = [put cancelByProductingResumeData:&error];
if (resumeData) {
QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest* request = [QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest requestWithRequestData:resumeData];
 }
 //The generated request for resuming upload can be directly uploaded
 [[QCloudCOSTransferMangerService defaultCOSTransferManager] UploadObject:request];

```

Note: The multipart upload uses the serial mode where parts must be uploaded in sequence. Under the following circumstances, resuming upload from breakpoint cannot be used.

- The file to be uploaded is smaller than 1 MB and multipart upload is not used.
- A simple upload API rather than the QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest class is used to upload files.
- Multipart upload initialization is not completed (the callback for completed upload initialization is yet to be called) when you cancel the generation of resumeData.

### Download a file

See the [Download a file](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/11280#3.-.E4.B8.8B.E8.BD.BD.E6.96.87.E4.BB.B6) section in Getting Started.

### Copy a file

#### Notes

Initialize a QCloudCOSXMLCopyObjectRequest object, and then call CopyObject of QCloudCOSTransferMangerService. Note that multipart copy is automatically used for large files, but users will not be aware of this process.  

> For cross-origin replication, the region of transferManager must be the same as that of the bucket.

#### Example

```objective-c
QCloudCOSXMLCopyObjectRequest* request = [[QCloudCOSXMLCopyObjectRequest alloc] init];
request.bucket = @"Destination bucket";
request.object = @"Destination file name";
request.sourceBucket = @"File source bucket. Public read or access to the current account is required";
request.sourceObject = @"Source file name";
request.sourceAPPID = @"Source APPID";
request.sourceRegion= @"Source region";
[request setFinishBlock:^(QCloudCopyObjectResult* result, NSError* error) {
    //Complete callback
    if (nil == error) {
      //Successful
    }
}];
//For cross-origin replication, the region of transferManager must be the same as that of the bucket.
[[QCloudCOSTransferMangerService defaultCOSTransferManager] CopyObject:request];
```

## Service Operations

### List all buckets - Get Service

This API (Get Service) is used to obtain all Bucket lists of the requester.

#### Parameters of returned result QCloudListAllMyBucketsResult

| Parameter Name | Description | Type |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| owner | Bucket owner information | QCloudOwner * |
| buckets | All bucket information | NSArray<QCloudBucket*> * |

#### Example

```objective-c
QCloudGetServiceRequest* request = [[QCloudGetServiceRequest alloc] init];
[request setFinishBlock:^(QCloudListAllMyBucketsResult* result, NSError* error) {
//Process after callback is completed
}];
[[QCloudCOSXMLService defaultCOSXML] GetService:request];
```

### Generate and use pre-signed URLs

You can generate a pre-signed URL from the SDK or server, and then upload, download or perform other operations as needed.

#### Description

1. Create a QCloudGetPresignedURLRequest instance.
2. Enter required information such as Bucket, Object, and HTTPMethod.
3. If additional HTTP headers or parameters are required for use, call the method in QCloudGetPresignedURLRequest to add them when generating pre-signed URLs.
4. Call getPresignedURL in QCloudCOSXMLService to send requests, and obtain pre-signed URLs in results.

#### QCloudGetPresignedURLRequest parameters

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ---- |
| bucket      | Bucket using a pre-signed request | NSString* | Yes |
| object | Object using a pre-signed request. ObjectKey is the unique identifier of an object in a bucket. For example, in the object's access domain name "bucket1-1250000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/doc1/pic1.jpg", the key is "doc1/pic1.jpg". For more information, see [Object Description](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13324). | NSString* | Yes |
| HTTPMethod  | HTTP method of the request using a pre-signed URL. Valid values (case-sensitive): @"GET", @"PUT", @"POST" and @"DELETE". | NSString* | Yes |
| contentType | This parameter is available when the request using a pre-signed URL has this header. | NSString* | No |
| contentMD5 | This parameter is available when the request using a pre-signed URL has this header. | NSString* | No |

**Note:** To set the header or URL parameter of the request using a pre-signed URL, do the following:    

```objective-c
/**
 Add the header of the request using a pre-signed request

 @param value HTTP header value
 @param requestHeader HTTP header key
 */
- (void)setValue:(NSString * _Nullable)value forRequestHeader:(NSString * _Nullable)requestHeader;

/**
 Add the URL parameter of the request using a pre-signed request

 @param value Parameter value
 @param requestParameter Parameter key
 */
- (void)setValue:(NSString * _Nullable)value forRequestParameter:(NSString *_Nullable)requestParameter;
```

#### Example on how to obtain a pre-signed URL

```objective-c
QCloudGetPresignedURLRequest* getPresignedURLRequest = [[QCloudGetPresignedURLRequest alloc] init];
getPresignedURLRequest.bucket = self.bucket;
getPresignedURLRequest.HTTPMethod = @"GET";
getPresignedURLRequest.object = @"testUploadWithPresignedURL";
[getPresignedURLRequest setFinishBlock:^(QCloudGetPresignedURLResult * _Nonnull result, NSError * _Nonnull error) {
if (nil == error) {
 NSString* presignedURL = result.presienedURL;
}
}
[[QCloudCOSXMLService defaultCOSXML] getPresignedURL:getPresignedURLRequest];

```

#### Example on how to use a pre-signed URL

The following example shows how to download with a pre-signed URL.

```objective-C
NSMutableURLRequest* request = [[NSMutableURLRequest alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"Pre-signed URL"]];
request.HTTPMethod = @"GET";
request.HTTPBody = [@"File content" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
[[[NSURLSession sharedSession] downloadTaskWithRequest:request completionHandler:^(NSURL * _Nullable location, NSURLResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    NSInteger statusCode = [(NSHTTPURLResponse*)response statusCode];
}] resume];
```

## Bucket Operations

### Create a bucket

#### Method prototype

Before using COS, you need to create a bucket under the specific account for use and management of objects, and define the region of the bucket. The creator of the bucket is the owner of the bucket by default. The bucket access permission is Private Read/Write by default if not otherwise specified upon creation. Specific steps are as follows:    

1. Instantiate QCloudPutBucketRequest and enter the required parameters.
2. Call the PutBucket method in the QCloudCOSXMLService object to initiate a request.
3. Obtain specific content from outputObject in finishBlock of callback. 

#### QCloudPutBucketRequest parameters

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ---- |
| bucket            | The name of the bucket to be created, which can be viewed in the [COS V5 Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket). Note that the bucket name can only consist of numbers and lowercase letters with a length limited to 40 characters; otherwise, the creation will fail. | NSString * | Yes |
| accessControlList | Defines the ACL attribute of a bucket. Valid values: private, public-read-write, public-read; Default: private | NSString * | No |
| grantRead | Grants read permission to the authorized user. Format: id=" ",id=" ". For authorization to a subaccount, id="qcs::cam::uin/&lt;OwnerUin>:uin/&lt;SubUin>"; for authorization to the root account, id="qcs::cam::uin/&lt;OwnerUin>:uin/&lt;OwnerUin>", where OwnerUin refers to the ID of the root account and SubUin refers to the ID of the subaccount. | NSString * | No |
| grantWrite | Grants write permission to the authorized user. The format is the same as above. | NSString * | No |
| grantFullControl | Grants read and write permissions to the authorized user. The format is the same as above. | NSString * | No |

#### Example

```objective-c
QCloudPutBucketRequest* request = [QCloudPutBucketRequest new];
request.bucket = @"bucketname-appid"; //additional actions after finishing
[request setFinishBlock:^(id outputObject, NSError* error) {

}];
[[QCloudCOSXMLService defaultCOSXML] PutBucket:request];
```

#### Error codes

When the SDK request fails, the error returned is not empty and includes the error code, error description, and other necessary debugging information to help developers quickly solve the problem.

Error codes (encapsulated in the returned error) include those returned by the device due to network problems and those returned by COS.

- Error codes generated by the device due to network problems are negative four digits, for example -1001. These error codes are defined by Apple. For more information, see the definitions in the header file NSURLError.h or [Apple's official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/1508628-url_loading_system_error_codes).

### Put Bucket Lifecycle

COS allows you to manage the lifecycle of an object in a bucket by configuring lifecycle. The lifecycle configuration contains one or more rule sets that will be applied to a group of object rules (each rule defines an operation for COS).
These operations are divided into the following two types:

- Transition: Specify the time when an object is transited to another storage class. For example, you can choose to transit an object to STANDARD_IA (applicable to infrequent access) storage class after 30 days of its creation.
- Expiration: Specify the expiration time of an Object. COS will automatically delete the objects that have expired.

Put Bucket Lifecycle is used to create a new lifecycle configuration for a Bucket. If the Bucket has been configured with a lifecycle, you can use this API to create a new configuration which will overwrite the existing one.

## Adding Custom Headers

You can add custom headers as needed. Classes allowing addition of custom headers are provided with the attribute customHeaders:

```objective-c
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSMutableDictionary* customHeaders;
```

Key-value pairs in this attribute will be added to the HTTP headers of creation requests accordingly.

## Server Encryption

You can encrypt the uploaded objects in the following ways.

### Use server-side encryption with COS-hosted encryption keys (SSE-COS) to protect data

COS can automatically encrypt data as it is written to the IDC and automatically decrypt it when you access it. COS master key is used to apply AES-256 encryption to data.

You can achieve this by calling -(void)setCOSServerSideEncyption in the iOS SDK.

```objective-c
[request setCOSServerSideEncyption];
```

### Use server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) to protect data

You can achieve this by calling -(void)setCOSServerSideEncyptionWithCustomerKey:(NSString *)customerKey in the iOS SDK.
  Note:

1. To use server side encryption, HTTPS connection is required. See the [Enable HTTPS Service](#https) section.
2. customerKey: The key provided by the user, which shall be a 32-byte string consisting of numbers, letters and strings. Chinese characters are not supported.
3. If the uploaded source file calls this method, it should also be called when downloading, querying, uploading and copying the source object using QCloudCOSXMLDownloadObjectRequest, QCloudHeadObjectRequest, QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest and QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest.

```objective-c
NSString *customKey = @"123456qwertyuioplkjhgfdsazxcvbnm";
[put setCOSServerSideEncyptionWithCustomerKey:customKey];
```

## <span id="https">Enable HTTPS Service</span>

The iOS SDK supports HTTPS requests. You only need to, when initializing the configuration object QCloudServiceConfiguration, set useHTTPS for its endpoint to YES.

```objective-c
QCloudServiceConfiguration* configuration = [QCloudServiceConfiguration new];
configuration.appID = kAppID;
configuration.signatureProvider = self;
QCloudCOSXMLEndPoint* endpoint = [[QCloudCOSXMLEndPoint alloc] init];
endpoint.regionName = kRegion;
endpoint.useHTTPS = YES;
configuration.endpoint = endpoint;
[QCloudCOSXMLService registerDefaultCOSXMLWithConfiguration:configuration];
[QCloudCOSTransferMangerService registerDefaultCOSTransferMangerWithConfiguration:configuration];
}
```
