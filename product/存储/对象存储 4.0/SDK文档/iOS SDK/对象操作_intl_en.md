## Advanced API (Recommended)

This section describes the advanced API that encapsulate the upload and copy operations. You only need to set the corresponding parameters, and the API will decide whether to perform simple upload/copy or multipart upload/copy according to the file size. Please confirm that the initialization as described in [Getting Started](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/11280) has been completed before you use this API.

### Uploading an Object

You can see the [Uploading an Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/11280#upload-a-file) section in Getting Started.

### Upload Resumption

If an object is larger than 1 MB, the SDK will upload it in a multipart manner, i.e., dividing it into multiple 1 MB parts and uploading them in parallel (up to 4 concurrent connections). The backend server will save each part upon upload completion, which serves as the basis for upload resumption.    

In the process of a multipart upload, a resumeData is generated when the multipart upload is completely initialized or canceled, which can be used to generate a new upload request for continued upload and the progress will be resumed. Below is an example of how to get the resumeData:

```objective-C
QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest* put = [QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest new];
// Set some parameters of the upload
put.initMultipleUploadFinishBlock = ^(QCloudInitiateMultipartUploadResult * multipleUploadInitResult, QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectResumeData resumeData) {
	// After the initialization of the multipart upload is completed, this block will be called back, where you can get the resumeData which can be used to generate a new multipart upload request
	QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest* request = [QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest requestWithRequestData:resumeData];
};

[[QCloudCOSTransferMangerService defaultCOSTransferManager] UploadObject:put];

//••• After initialization is completed before upload is completed
NSError* error;
// This is an example of resumetData generated after cancellation is called
resumeData = [put cancelByProductingResumeData:&error];
if (resumeData) {
QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest* request = [QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest requestWithRequestData:resumeData];
 }
 // The request generated for resumption can start an upload directly
 [[QCloudCOSTransferMangerService defaultCOSTransferManager] UploadObject:request];

```

Note that according to the mechanism of multipart upload, a part will be recorded and counted into the upload progress only after it is completely uploaded. In the following situations, an upload cannot be resumed; instead, it can only be restarted:

- The object to be uploaded is smaller than 1 MB, so multipart upload is not used.
- The simple upload API instead of the QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest class is used for upload.
- The initialization of the multipart upload has not been completed when the resumeData is generated upon cancellation, i.e., the callback of multipart upload initialization completion has not been called yet.

### Downloading an Object

You can see the [Downloading an Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/11280#download-a-file) section in Getting Started.

### Copying an Object

#### Notes

Initialize a QCloudCOSXMLCopyObjectRequest object and then call the CopyObject method of QCloudCOSTransferMangerService. Note that larger files will be copied in a multipart manner, which is imperceptible to the user.  

> For cross-region replication, the region of the transferManager used must be the region of the destination bucket.

#### QCloudCOSXMLCopyObjectRequest Parameter Descriptions

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ---- |
| bucket | Bucket name,  Its format is &lt;BucketName-APPID&gt;, such as examplebucket-1250000000 | NSString * | Yes |
| sourceBucket | Bucket of the file to be copied | NSString * | Yes |
| SourceObject | Object name (key) of the file to be copied | NSString * | Yes |
| sourceAPPID | APPID of the file to be copied | NSString * | Yes |
| sourceRegion | Region of the file to be copied | NSString * | Yes |
| metadataDirective | Whether to copy the metadata. Enumerated values: Copy, Replaced. Default value: Copy. If the flag is Copy, the user metadata in the header is ignored and the copy is performed directly; if the flag is Replaced, the metadata is modified based on the header information. If the destination path is the same as the source path (i.e., when you want to modify the metadata), the flag has to be Replaced | NSString * | No |
| storageClass | Storage class of an object. Enumerated values: STANDARD (QCloudCOSStorageStandard), STANDARD_IA (QCloudCOSStorageStandardIA). Default value: STANDARD (QCloudCOSStorageStandard) | QCloudCOSStorageClass | No |

#### Examples

```objective-c
QCloudCOSXMLCopyObjectRequest* request = [[QCloudCOSXMLCopyObjectRequest alloc] init];
request.bucket = @"examplebucket-1250000000";// Destination <BucketName-APPID>, which should be public read or accessible by the current account
request.object = @"text.txt";// Destination file name
request.sourceBucket = @"examplebucket-1250000000";// File source <BucketName-APPID>, which should be public read or accessible by the current account
request.sourceObject = @"text.txt";// Source file name
request.sourceAPPID = @"appid";// Source file appid
request.sourceRegion= @"ap-beijing";// Source region
[request setFinishBlock:^(QCloudCopyObjectResult* result, NSError* error) {
    // Complete the callback
   // You can get information such as etag or custom header in the response from outputObject (more header information can be viewed by printing the outputObject)
    if (nil == error) {
      // Success
    }
}];
// For cross-region replication, the region of the transferManager used must be the region of the destination bucket
[[QCloudCOSTransferMangerService defaultCOSTransferManager] CopyObject:request];
```

## Simple Operations

### Getting Object List

#### Feature Description

This API (Object List) is used to get all objects in a bucket.

#### Method Prototype

Before performing a bucket operation, you need to import the header QCloudCOSXML/QCloudCOSXML.h after completing the [initialization](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/11280#step1). First, generate a QCloudGetBucketRequest instance, enter some additional required restrictions, have them passed, and get the content. The steps are as follows:

1. Instantiate QCloudGetBucketRequest and enter the required parameters.    
2. Call the GetBucket method in the QCloudCOSXMLService object to initiate a request.    
3. Get the specific content from the QCloudListBucketResult in the finishBlock of the callback.   

#### QCloudGetBucketRequest Parameter Descriptions

//additional actions after finishing
}];
[[QCloudCOSXMLService defaultCOSXML] GetBucket:request];
```

#### Notes on Returned Error Codes

When an SDK request fails, the returned error will not be empty and will include error code, error message, and other information required for troubleshooting to help developers fix the problem quickly.

There are mainly two types of returned error codes (encapsulated in the returned error): error codes returned by the device for network reasons and error codes returned by COS.

- All the error codes returned by the device for network reasons are 4-digit negative numbers such as -1001, which are defined by Apple. For more information, see the definitions in the NSURLError.h header of the Foundation framework or [Apple's official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/1508628-url_loading_system_error_codes).
- Error codes returned by COS are based on HTTP status codes such as 404 and 503. For solutions to this type of error codes, see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7730).
- All the error codes customized by the SDK are 5-digit positive numbers such as 10000 and 20000. For solutions to this type of error codes, see [SDK Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30610).

### Uploading an Object

#### Feature Description

This API (Put Object) is used to upload an object to the specified bucket. Simple upload can be used for small files (below 20 MB) only, but it supports uploading files from the memory.

>  Currently, there can be up to 1,000 entries in one ACL. If you do not need access control for the object, do not set it during the upload, so that the object will inherit the permissions of the bucket.

#### QCloudPutObjectRequest Parameter Descriptions

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ---- |
| Object | An object key (Key) is a unique ID of an object in the bucket. For example, in the object's access domain name examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/doc/picture.jpg, the object key is doc/picture.jpg. For more information, see [Object Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13324) | NSString * | Yes |
| bucket   | Bucket name in the format of &lt;BucketName-APPID&gt;, such as examplebucket-1250000000, which can be viewed in the [COS V5 Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket) | NSString * | Yes   |
| body | If the file to be uploaded is stored on the disk, this parameter is the path to the file, and you should enter a `variable in NSURL * type`. If the file is stored in the memory, you can enter a `variable in NSData * type containing the file's binary data | BodyType | Yes |
| storageClass | Storage class of an object. Enumerated values: STANDARD (QCloudCOSStorageStandard), STANDARD_IA (QCloudCOSStorageStandardIA), ARCHIVE (QCloudCOSStorageARCHIVE). Default value: STANDARD (QCloudCOSStorageStandard) | QCloudCOSStorageClass | No |
| cacheControl | Cache policy as defined in RFC 2616, which will be stored as the object's metadata | NSString * | No |
| contentDisposition | File name as defined in RFC 2616, which will be stored as the object's metadata | NSString * | No |
| expect | If expect=@"100-Continue" is used, the request content will be sent only after confirmation from the server is received | NSString * | No|
| expires | File date and time as defined in RFC 2616, which will be stored as the object's metadata | NSString * | No |
| accessControlList | Defines the ACL attribute of the object, such as private, public-read, and default; default value: default (i.e., inheriting the bucket's permissions). Note: Currently, there can be up to 1,000 entries in one ACL. If you do not need access control for the object, use "default" for this parameter or simply leave it blank, so that the object will inherit the permissions of the bucket | NSString * | No |
| grantRead         | Grants the grantee read permission in the format of id="OwnerUin"                    | NSString * | No |
| grantWrite        | Grants the grantee write permission in the format of id="OwnerUin"                    | NSString * | No   |
| grantFullControl  | Grants the grantee read/write permission in the format of id="OwnerUin"                    | NSString * | No   |

#### Examples    

```objective-C
QCloudPutObjectRequest* put = [QCloudPutObjectRequest new];
put.object = @"text.txt";
put.bucket = @"examplebucket-1250000000";
put.body =  [@"testFileContent" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
[put setFinishBlock:^(id outputObject, NSError *error) {
   // Complete the callback
  // You can get information such as etag or custom header in the response from outputObject (more header information can be viewed by printing the outputObject)
  if (nil == error) {
   // Success
   }
   }];
[[QCloudCOSXMLService defaultCOSXML] PutObject:put];

 }];

[[QCloudCOSXMLService defaultCOSXML] OptionsObject:request];

```

#### Notes on Returned Error Codes

When an SDK request fails, the returned error will not be empty and will include error code, error message, and other information required for troubleshooting to help developers fix the problem quickly.

There are mainly two types of returned error codes (encapsulated in the returned error): error codes returned by the device for network reasons and error codes returned by COS.

- All the error codes returned by the device for network reasons are 4-digit negative numbers such as -1001, which are defined by Apple. For more information, see the definitions in the NSURLError.h header of the Foundation framework or [Apple's official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/1508628-url_loading_system_error_codes).
- Error codes returned by COS are based on HTTP status codes such as 404 and 503. For solutions to this type of error codes, see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7730).
- All the error codes customized by the SDK are 5-digit positive numbers such as 10000 and 20000. For solutions to this type of error codes, see [SDK Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30610).

  request.bucket = @"examplebucket-1250000000";
  request.object = @" ";
  [request setFinishBlock:^(QCloudCopyObjectResult * _Nonnull result, NSError * _Nonnull error) {

  }];
  request.objectCopySource = objectCopySource;// Path to the source object
  [[QCloudCOSXMLService defaultCOSXML]  PutObjectCopy:request];
```

QCloudUploadPartResult parameter descriptions

| Parameter Name | Description | Type |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| eTag     | File etag | NSString * |

#### Method Prototype

The steps to initiate a multipart upload request in the COS SDK for iOS are as follows:

1. Instantiate QCloudUploadPartCopyRequest and enter the required parameters.
2. Call the UploadPartCopy method in the QCloudCOSXMLService object to initiate a request.
3. Get the specific content from the QCloudCopyObjectResult in the finishBlock of the callback.

#### Examples

```objective-c
QCloudUploadPartCopyRequest* request = [[QCloudUploadPartCopyRequest alloc] init];
request.bucket = @"examplebucket-1250000000";
request.object = @"text.txt";
request.source = @"objectCopySource"; // Source file URL path. A previous version can be specified using the versionid sub-resource
request.uploadID = @"uploadID"; // In the response of multipart upload initialization, a unique descriptor (upload ID) is returned
request.partNumber = 1; // Current part number
[request setFinishBlock:^(QCloudCopyObjectResult* result, NSError* error) {
}];
[[QCloudCOSXMLService defaultCOSXML]UploadPartCopy:request];
```

#### Notes on Returned Error Codes

When an SDK request fails, the returned error will not be empty and will include error code, error message, and other information required for troubleshooting to help developers fix the problem quickly.

There are mainly two types of returned error codes (encapsulated in the returned error): error codes returned by the device for network reasons and error codes returned by COS.

- All the error codes returned by the device for network reasons are 4-digit negative numbers such as -1001, which are defined by Apple. For more information, see the definitions in the NSURLError.h header of the Foundation framework or [Apple's official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/1508628-url_loading_system_error_codes).
- Error codes returned by COS are based on HTTP status codes such as 404 and 503. For solutions to this type of error codes, see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7730).
- All the error codes customized by the SDK are 5-digit positive numbers such as 10000 and 20000. For solutions to this type of error codes, see [SDK Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30610).

- All the error codes customized by the SDK are 5-digit positive numbers such as 10000 and 20000. For solutions to this type of error codes, see [SDK Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30610).

## Adding a Custom Header

You can add custom headers to a request. All classes that support adding custom headers have the customHeaders attribute:

```objective-c
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSMutableDictionary* customHeaders;
```

All key-value pairs within this attribute will be added to the HTTP header that builds the request in the corresponding form.

## Server-side Encryption

If you need to encrypt the uploaded object, the following encryption methods can be used.

### Server-side Encryption (SSE-COS) Using COS-managed Encryption Keys

COS will automatically encrypt the data as it is written to the IDC and automatically decrypt it when you retrieve it. Currently, AES-256 encryption with the COS master key is supported.

The SDK for iOS does so by calling the -(void)setCOSServerSideEncyption method.

```objective-c
[request setCOSServerSideEncyption];
```

### Server-side Encryption (SSE-C) Using Customer-supplied Encryption Keys

The SDK for iOS does so by calling the -(void)setCOSServerSideEncyptionWithCustomerKey:(NSString \*)customerKey method.


>- The service that the encryption runs should use an HTTPS request.
>- customerKey: Customer-supplied key. Pass in a 32-byte string which can contain number, letters, and special characters.
>- If the uploaded source object calls this method, it should also be called when QCloudCOSXMLDownloadObjectRequest (download), QCloudHeadObjectRequest (query), QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest (upload), and QCloudCOSXMLUploadObjectRequest (copy) are used to manipulate the source object.

```objective-c
NSString *customKey = @"123456qwertyuioplkjhgfdsazxcvbnm";
[put setCOSServerSideEncyptionWithCustomerKey:customKey];
```
