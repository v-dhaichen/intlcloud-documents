### Querying Object List

#### Feature Description

This API is used to query some or all objects in a bucket.

#### Method Prototype

```java
public ObjectListing listObjects(ListObjectsRequest listObjectsRequest) throws CosClientException, CosServiceException;
```

#### Parameter Descriptions

| Parameter Name | Description | Type |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| listObjectsRequest | Request to get the file list | ListObjectsRequest |

Request member description:

| Request Member | Setting Method | Description | Type |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| bucketName  | Constructor or set method | Bucket name in the format of BucketName-APPID. For more information, see [Naming Convention](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13312#naming-conventions) | String |

| delimiter | Constructor or set method | Delimiter, limiting that the returned path must start with prefix and end in the first appearance of delimiter | String |
| maxKeys | Constructor or set method | Maximum number of members to be returned (up to 1,000) <br>Default value: 1,000 | Integer |

#### Return Result Descriptions

- Success: The ObjectListing type is returned, containing all members and nextMarker.  
- Failure: A CosClientException or CosServiceException exception was thrown. For more information, see [Troubleshooting](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/31537).

#### Sample Request

```java
// Bucket name is in the format of BucketName-APPID. The bucket name entered here must be in this format
String bucketName = "examplebucket-1250000000";

// Request to get the members in the bucket
ListObjectsRequest listObjectsRequest = new ListObjectsRequest();
listObjectsRequest.setBucketName(bucketName);
// Set the prefix of the list, indicating that the listed file keys must start with this prefix
listObjectsRequest.setPrefix("");
// Set the delimiter to /, indicating to get direct members excluding recursive sub-members under the directory
listObjectsRequest.setDelimiter("/");
// Set the marker (which is obtained from the last list or is empty if listObjects is called for the first time)
listObjectsRequest.setMarker("");
// Set the maximum number of entries returned in the list (if this is not set, the default value of 1,000 will be used; up to 1,000 keys can be listed in one list)
listObjectsRequest.setMaxKeys(100);

ObjectListing objectListing = cosClient.listObjects(listObjectsRequest);
// Get the marker of the next list
String nextMarker = objectListing.getNextMarker();
// Determine whether the list is finished, and if yes, isTruncated is false; otherwise, true
boolean isTruncated = objectListing.isTruncated();
List<COSObjectSummary> objectSummaries = objectListing.getObjectSummaries();
for (COSObjectSummary cosObjectSummary : objectSummaries) {
    // File path
    String key = cosObjectSummary.getKey();
    // Get the file length
    long fileSize = cosObjectSummary.getSize();
    // Get the file ETag
    String eTag = cosObjectSummary.getETag();
    // Get the last modified time
    Date lastModified = cosObjectSummary.getLastModified();
    // Get the file storage class
    String storageClass = cosObjectSummary.getStorageClass();
}
```

### Simply Uploading an Object

#### Feature Description

This API (Put Object) is used to upload an object to the specified bucket in order to upload a local file or input stream with a known length to COS. This is applicable to uploading small image files (below 20 MB). The maximum supported file size is 5 GB. For files over 5 GB, please use multipart upload or advanced API.

- The file length and MD5 are checked by default during the upload (for more information on how to disable MD5 check, see the sample code).
- If an object with the same key already exists in COS, it will be overwritten during the upload.
- Currently, there can be up to 1,000 entries in one ACL. If you do not need access control for the object, do not set it during the upload, so that the object will inherit the permissions of the bucket.
- After the file is uploaded, you can call the `GetObject` API using the same `key` to download the file to the local file system or generate a pre-signed link. (For a download operation, specify the method as `GET`. For detailed API descriptions, see below.) This link can be shared for download.

#### Method Prototype

```java
// Method 1. Upload a local file to COS
public PutObjectResult putObject(String bucketName, String key, File file)
            throws CosClientException, CosServiceException;
// Method 2. Upload an input stream to COS
public PutObjectResult putObject(String bucketName, String key, InputStream input, ObjectMetadata metadata)
            throws CosClientException, CosServiceException;
// Method 3. Encapsulate the first two methods, which supports more fine-grained control of parameters such as content-type and content-disposition
public PutObjectResult putObject(PutObjectRequest putObjectRequest)
            throws CosClientException, CosServiceException;
```

#### Parameter Descriptions

| Parameter Name | Description | Type |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| putObjectRequest | File upload request | PutObjectRequest |

Request member description:

| Request Member | Setting Method | Description | Type |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| bucketName  | Constructor or set method | Bucket name in the format of BucketName-APPID. For more information, see [Naming Convention](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13312#naming-conventions) | String |
| key | Constructor or set method | An object key (Key) is a unique ID of an object in the bucket. For example, in the object's access domain name `examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/doc/picture.jpg`, the object key is doc/picture.jpg. For more information, see [Object Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13324) | String |
| file | Constructor or set method | Local file | File |
| input | Constructor or set method | Input stream | InputStream |
| metadata | Constructor or set method | File metadata | ObjectMetadata |

The ObjectMetadata class is used to record the metadata of an object. Its main members are as described below:

| Member Name | Description | Type |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------  |
| httpExpiresDate | Cache expiration time, which is the value of the Expires field in the HTTP response header | Date |
| ongoingRestore | The object is being restored from the archive storage class | Boolean |
| userMetadata | User-defined metadata prefixed with x-cos-meta- | Map<String, String> |
| metadata | Headers other than user-defined metadata | Map<String, String> |

#### Return Result Descriptions

- Success: PutObjectResult is returned, which contains the file's information such as ETag.
- Failure: An error (e.g., authentication failed) occurred and a CosClientException or CosServiceException exception was thrown. For more information, see [Troubleshooting](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/31537).

#### Sample Request

// Bucket name is in the format of BucketName-APPID. The bucket name entered here must be in this format
String bucketName = "examplebucket-1250000000";
// Method 1. Upload a local file
File localFile = new File("exampleobject");
String key = "exampleobject";
PutObjectResult putObjectResult = cosClient.putObject(bucketName, key, localFile);
String etag = putObjectResult.getETag();  // Get etag of the file

// Method 2. Upload an input stream (the length of the input stream should be specified in advance; otherwise, OOM may occur)
FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(localFile);
ObjectMetadata objectMetadata = new ObjectMetadata();
// Set the input stream length to 500
objectMetadata.setContentLength(500);  
// Set the Content type which is application/octet-stream by default
objectMetadata.setContentType("application/pdf");
PutObjectResult putObjectResult = cosClient.putObject(bucketName, key, fileInputStream, objectMetadata);
String etag = putObjectResult.getETag();
// Close the input stream...

// Method 3 provides more fine-grained controls. Common settings are as follows:
// 1. Storage class; enumerated values: Standard, Standard_IA, Archive; default value: Standard
// 2. content-type. For local file uploads, mapping based on the local file extensions will be performed by default, for example, .jpg files will be mapped to image/jpeg
// For streaming uploads, the default value is application/octet-stream
// 3. Specify the permission while uploading (which can also be set by calling the set object acl API)
// 4. To globally disable upload MD5 check, set the system environment variable, which will affect all upload checks. Checks are performed by default
// Disable MD5 check: System.setProperty(SkipMd5CheckStrategy.DISABLE_PUT_OBJECT_MD5_VALIDATION_PROPERTY, "true");
// Enable check again: System.setProperty(SkipMd5CheckStrategy.DISABLE_PUT_OBJECT_MD5_VALIDATION_PROPERTY, null);
File localFile = new File("picture.jpg");
String key = "picture.jpg";
PutObjectRequest putObjectRequest = new PutObjectRequest(bucketName, key, file);

### Setting Object ACL

#### Feature Description

This API is used to set the ACL for the specified object in a bucket.

> Currently, there can be up to 1,000 entries in one ACL. If you do not need access control for the object, do not set it, so that the object will inherit the permissions of the bucket.

The ACL can be divided into predefined ACL (CannedAccessControlList) and custom ACL (AccessControlList). When both types of ACLs are set at the same time, the predefined ACL will be ignored and the custom one will prevail.
#### Method Prototype

```java
// Method 1 (setting a custom ACL)
public void setObjectAcl(String bucketName, String key, AccessControlList acl)
       throws CosClientException, CosServiceException
// Method 2 (setting a preset ACL)
public void setObjectAcl(String bucketName, String key, CannedAccessControlList acl)
       throws CosClientException, CosServiceException
// Method 3 (encapsulating both methods above, i.e., containing two types of ACLs; if set simultaneously, the custom ACL will prevail)
public void setObjectAcl(SetObjectAclRequest setObjectAclRequest)
  throws CosClientException, CosServiceException;
```

#### Parameter Descriptions

- The parameters of **method 3** cover methods 1 and 2 and thus are used here as an example.

String key = "exampleobject";
AccessControlList acl = cosClient.getObjectAcl(bucketName, key);
```

## Advanced API (Recommended)

The advanced API encapsulates the upload and download APIs through the TransferManager class. It has a thread pool to accept your upload and download requests, so that you can choose to submit tasks asynchronously.

```java
// Thread pool size. It is recommended to set this to 16 or 32 as long as the client and COS have sufficient network resources (for example, Tencent Cloud CVM is used, or the upload to COS is performed intra-region), which can fully utilize the network resources.
// For scenarios where a public network with low bandwidth and poor network quality is used for data transfer, it is recommended to lower this value to avoid request timeout due to slow network transfer.
ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(32);
// Pass in a thread pool. If no thread pool is passed in, a single-threaded thread pool will be generated in TransferManager by default.
TransferManager transferManager = new TransferManager(cosClient, threadPool);
// ...(submit an upload or download request as described below)
// Close TransferManger
transferManager.shutdownNow();
```

### Uploading an Object

## Client Encryption

#### Feature Description

The SDK for Java supports client-side encryption based on symmetric AES or asymmetric RSA where files are encrypted before uploaded and decrypted when downloaded.
The symmetry and asymmetry involved here are only used to encrypt the random key generated each time, while AES-256 symmetric encryption is always used for file data encryption.
Client-side encryption is suitable for storage of sensitive data at the expense of upload speed. For multipart uploads, the SDK uploads the files in a serial manner.

### Preparations Before Using Client-side Encryption

Client-side encryption uses AES-256 to encrypt data internally. By default, older versions (v6-8) of JDK do not support 256-bit encryption and will display the following exception during execution: `java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size or default parameters`. In this case, you need to deploy Oracle's JCE unlimited strength jurisdiction policy file to the JRE. Please download the file corresponding to the currently used JDK version and extract it to the jre/lib/security directory under JAVA_HOME.

1. [JDK6 JCE file](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-6-download-429243.html)
2. [JDK7 JCE file](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html)
3. [JDK8 JCE file](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html)

### Upload Encryption Flow

1. Before a file object is uploaded, a symmetric encryption key is generated randomly, which is encrypted with the user-supplied symmetric or asymmetric key, and the encryption result is Base64-encoded and stored in the object's metadata.
2. The file object is encrypted in the memory using the AES-256 algorithm during upload.

### Download Decryption Flow

1. The information necessary for encryption in the file metadata is obtained, Base64-decoded, and decrypted with the user-supplied key to obtained the key used to encrypt the data in the first place.
2. The downloaded input stream is decrypted with the obtained key using AES-256 to get the decrypted file input stream.

#### Sample Request

Example 1. Encrypt the key randomly generated each time using symmetric AES-256. For the complete sample code, see [Complete Sample of Client-side Encryption with a Symmetric Key](https://github.com/tencentyun/cos-java-sdk-v5/blob/master/src/main/java/com/qcloud/cos/demo/SymmetricKeyEncryptionClientDemo.java).

```java
// Initialize the user credentials (secretId, secretKey)
String secretId = "COS_SECRETID";
String secretKey = "COS_SECRETKEY";
COSCredentials cred = new BasicCOSCredentials(secretId, secretKey);
// Set the bucket region. For abbreviations of COS regions, see https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(new Region("ap-beijing"));

// Load the key saved in the file. If it does not exist, use buildAndSaveSymmetricKey to generate a key first
// buildAndSaveSymmetricKey();
SecretKey symKey = loadSymmetricAESKey();

EncryptionMaterials encryptionMaterials = new EncryptionMaterials(symKey);
// Use AES/GCM mode and store the encrypted information in the file metadata
CryptoConfiguration cryptoConf = new CryptoConfiguration(CryptoMode.AuthenticatedEncryption)
		.withStorageMode(CryptoStorageMode.ObjectMetadata);

// Generate the encryption client EncryptionClient, which is a subclass of COSClient and supports all APIs supported by COSClient
// EncryptionClient overwrites the upload and download logics of COSClient and performs encryption internally. Its logics of other operations are the same as those of COSClient
COSEncryptionClient cosEncryptionClient =
		new COSEncryptionClient(new COSStaticCredentialsProvider(cred),
				new StaticEncryptionMaterialsProvider(encryptionMaterials), clientConfig,
				cryptoConf);

// Upload the file
// Here is an example of putObject. For an upload using the advanced API, just pass in the COSEncryptionClient object when generating TransferManager
String bucketName = "examplebucket-1250000000";
String key = "exampleobject";
File localFile = new File("src/test/resources/plain.txt");
PutObjectRequest putObjectRequest = new PutObjectRequest(bucketName, key, localFile);
cosEncryptionClient.putObject(putObjectRequest);
```

Example 2. Encrypt the key randomly generated each time using asymmetric RSA. For the complete sample code, see [Complete Sample of Client-side Encryption with an Asymmetric Key](https://github.com/tencentyun/cos-java-sdk-v5/blob/master/src/main/java/com/qcloud/cos/demo/AsymmetricKeyEncryptionClientDemo.java).

```java
// Initialize the user credentials (secretId, secretKey)
String secretId = "COS_SECRETID";
String secretKey = "COS_SECRETKEY";
COSCredentials cred = new BasicCOSCredentials(secretId, secretKey);
// Set the bucket region. For abbreviations of COS regions, see https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(new Region("ap-beijing"));


// Load the key saved in the file. If it does not exist, use buildAndSaveAsymKeyPair to generate a key first
buildAndSaveAsymKeyPair();
KeyPair asymKeyPair = loadAsymKeyPair();

EncryptionMaterials encryptionMaterials = new EncryptionMaterials(asymKeyPair);
// Use AES/GCM mode and store the encrypted information in the file metadata
CryptoConfiguration cryptoConf = new CryptoConfiguration(CryptoMode.AuthenticatedEncryption)
		.withStorageMode(CryptoStorageMode.ObjectMetadata);

// Generate the encryption client EncryptionClient, which is a subclass of COSClient and supports all APIs supported by COSClient
// EncryptionClient overwrites the upload and download logics of COSClient and performs encryption internally. Its logics of other operations are the same as those of COSClient
COSEncryptionClient cosEncryptionClient =
		new COSEncryptionClient(new COSStaticCredentialsProvider(cred),
				new StaticEncryptionMaterialsProvider(encryptionMaterials), clientConfig,
				cryptoConf);

// Upload the file
// Here is an example of putObject. For an upload using the advanced API, just pass in the COSEncryptionClient object when generating TransferManager
String bucketName = "examplebucket-1250000000";
String key = "exampleobject";
File localFile = new File("src/test/resources/plain.txt");
PutObjectRequest putObjectRequest = new PutObjectRequest(bucketName, key, localFile);
cosEncryptionClient.putObject(putObjectRequest);
