### Simply Uploading an Object

#### Feature Description

This API (PUT Object) is used to upload a local object to the specified bucket. The requester of this operation should have write permission to the bucket.

> 
>
> 1. Key (file name) cannot end in `/`; otherwise, it will be recognized as a folder.
2. The total number of policies associated with the ACL, Policy, and CAM of a bucket under one single root account (i.e., under the same APPID) can be up to 1,000. The number of object ACL rules is not limited. If you do not need access control for the object, do not set it during the upload, so that the object will inherit the permissions of the bucket.
> 3. After the object is uploaded, you can use the same key to generate a pre-signed link. (For a download operation, specify the method as GET. For detailed API descriptions, see below.) This link can be shared for download. However, please note that if your file is private-read, then the pre-signed link is only valid for a certain period of time.

#### Use Cases

Simple upload is suitable for uploading small files.

```js
cos.putObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */
    Region: 'ap-beijing',    /* Required */
    Key: 'picture.jpg',              /* Required */
    StorageClass: 'STANDARD',
    Body: file, // Upload the file object
    onProgress: function(progressData) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(progressData));
    }
}, function(err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```

Upload a string as the file content:

```js
cos.putObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */
    Region: 'ap-beijing',    /* Required */
    Key: 'picture.jpg',              /* Required */
    Body: 'hello!',
}, function(err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```

Create a directory:

```js
cos.putObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */
    Region: 'ap-beijing',    /* Required */
    Key: 'a/',              /* Required */

### Pre-requesting Cross-origin Configuration

#### Feature Description

This API (OPTIONS Object) is used to implement a pre-request for an cross-origin object access configuration, i.e., an OPTIONS request carrying the specific source origin, HTTP method, and header information is sent to COS for it to determine whether a real cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) request can be made. If no CORS configuration exists, 403 Forbidden will be returned for the request. **You can enable the CORS support of a bucket using the PUT Bucket cors API.**

#### Use Cases

```js
cos.optionsObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */
    Region: 'ap-beijing',    /* Required */
    Key: 'picture.jpg',              /* Required */

### Setting Object Replication

#### Feature Description

This API (PUT Object - Copy) is used to copy a file from the source path to the destination path. It is recommended for files of 1 MB to 5 GB in size. For files over 5 GB, use the Upload - Copy API for multipart copy. Meta attributes and ACLs of the file can be modified during the copy process. You can use this API to copy a file, modify its attributes (the source file attributes are the same as the destination file attributes), move it, or rename it (copy it first and then call the deleting API separately).

#### Use Cases

```js
cos.putObjectCopy({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000',                               /* Required */

### Completing a Multipart Upload

#### Feature Description

This API (Complete Multipart Upload) is used to complete the entire multipart upload. After all parts are uploaded using the Upload Parts API, this API must be called to complete the multipart upload of the entire file. When using this API, you must specify the PartNumber and ETag of each part in the request body to verify the accuracy of parts.
As the parts need to be merged after they are uploaded, and the merge takes several minutes, when the merge starts, COS will immediately return status code 200 and periodically return space information during the merge process to keep the connection active until the merge is completed. After that, COS will return the content of the merged parts in the body.

- If the uploaded part size is below 1 MB, 400 EntityTooSmall will be returned when this API is called.
- If the uploaded part numbers are not continuous, 400 InvalidPart will be returned when this API is called.
- If the part information entries in the request body are not sorted by number in ascending order, 400 InvalidPartOrder will be returned when this API is called.
- If the UploadId does not exist, 404 NoSuchUpload will be returned when this API is called.

#### Use Cases

```js
cos.multipartComplete({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */

This API (Slice Copy File) is used to copy a file from the source path to the destination path through multipart copy. Meta attributes and ACLs of the object can be modified during the copy process. You can use this API to move, rename, and copy a file or modify its attributes.

#### Method Prototype

Call the Slice Copy File operation:

```js
cos.sliceCopyFile({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000',                               /* Required */
    Region: 'ap-beijing',                                  /* Required */
    Key: '1.zip',                                            /* Required */
    CopySource: 'test.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/2.zip', /* Required */
    onProgress:function (progressData) {                     /* Optional */
        console.log(JSON.stringify(progressData));
    }
},function (err,data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```

### Batch Upload

#### Feature Description

Method 1:
You can directly call putObject and sliceUploadFile to implement batch uploads. You can control the number of file concurrences by instantiating the FileParallelLimit parameter, which is 3 by default.

Method 2:
You can call cos.uploadFiles to implement batch uploads. The SliceSize method parameter can be used to control the file. Below are instructions of the uploadFiles method.

#### Method Prototype

Call the uploadFiles operation:

```js
cos.uploadFiles({
    files: [{
        Bucket: config.Bucket, // Bucket in the format of BucketName-APPID
        Region: config.Region,
        Key: 'picture.jpg',
        Body: file1,
    }, {
        Bucket: config.Bucket, // Bucket in the format of BucketName-APPID
        Region: config.Region,
        Key: '2.jpg',
        Body: file2,
    }],
    SliceSize: 1024 * 1024,
    onProgress: function (info) {
        var percent = parseInt(info.percent * 10000) / 100;
        var speed = parseInt(info.speed / 1024 / 1024 * 100) / 100;
        console.log('progress:' + percent + '%; speed:' + speed + 'Mb/s;');
    },
    onFileFinish: function (err, data, options) {
        console.log(options.Key + 'uploaded' + (err ? 'failed' : 'completed'));
    },
}, function (err, data) {

### Upload Queue

The SDK for JavaScript retains queues of upload tasks initiated by putObject and sliceUploadFile, which can be used in the following ways:

1. cos.getTaskList can get the task list.
2. cos.pauseTask, cos.restartTask, and cos.cancelTask can operate the task.
3. cos.on('list-update', callback); can listen to the list and progress changes.

For a complete example of queue usage, see [Queue Demo](https://github.com/tencentyun/cos-js-sdk-v5/tree/master/demo/queue).

#### Canceling an Upload Task

This API is used to cancel an upload task based on the taskId.

**Use cases**

```js
var taskId = 'xxxxx';                   /* Required */
cos.cancelTask(taskId);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---- |
| taskId | File upload task number. When the sliceUploadFile method is called, its TaskReady callback will return the taskId of the upload task | String | Yes |

#### Pausing an Upload Task

This API is used to pause an upload task based on the taskId.

**Use cases**

```js
var taskId = 'xxxxx';                   /* Required */
cos.pauseTask(taskId);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---- |
| taskId | File upload task number. When the sliceUploadFile method is called, its TaskReady callback will return the taskId of the upload task | String | Yes |

#### Restarting an Upload Task

This API is used to restart an upload task based on the taskId that has been manually paused (by calling the pauseTask API) or stopped due to an upload error.

**Use cases**

```js
var taskId = 'xxxxx';                   /* Required */
cos.restartTask(taskId);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter Name | Description | Type | Required |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---- |
