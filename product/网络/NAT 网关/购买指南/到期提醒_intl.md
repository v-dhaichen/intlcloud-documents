There are grace periods after your NAT gateway expires:
- You have can still use NAT gateway for **2** hours and get billed after your account balance drops to 0.
- If your account balance fails to be topped up to an amount greater than 0 after 2 hours, the NAT gateway service is automatically suspended and the billing is stopped.
- Within 24 hours of service suspension, if you fail to add funds and maintain a positive account balance, NAT gateway will remain unavailable. If the balance is over 0, gateway service and billing will resume.
- When your account balance remains negative for more than 24 hours after gateway suspension, NAT gateway will be reclaimed immediately.
- Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators will get email and SMS notifications upon the reclamation.
