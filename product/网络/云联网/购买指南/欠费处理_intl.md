The following measures will be taken if your account payment is past due:
1. When your balance falls below zero, you can continue to use CCN for the next 24 hours. We will also continue to bill you for this usage.
2. After 24 hours, if your account is not topped up to a positive balance, CCN service and billing will automatically be stopped. Your service will remain unavailable if your balance is not positive within 7 days after automatic shutdown. If your balance is positive, CCN and billing can be resumed.
3. If your balance remains negative more than 7 days after automatic shutdown, CCN instance will be permanently terminated. Email and SMS notifications will be sent to the Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators.
