### Adding a Domain Name
The domain name for which to purchase a package needs to be first added to the first-level domain name list. Log in to the [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com), select **Products** -> **Domain Name and Website** -> **DNS**, and click **Add resolution** under **My Domain Names** as shown in the figure below:

After adding a domain name, you can first purchase a package and then modify the DNS server settings with the registrar and those two tasks don't affect each other.
### Purchasing a Package
Tencent Cloud DNS provides a free package for the newly added domain name by default, and you can select the domain name in the domain name list and click **Free** -> **Upgrade package** to jump to the package purchase page to purchase a package.

Or, you can go to the [purchase page](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/cns) to purchase a package directly. The purchase page provides a comparison of the specification of the five packages. You can purchase according to your actual needs.
