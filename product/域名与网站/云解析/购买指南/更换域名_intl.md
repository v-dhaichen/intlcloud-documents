### Modifying a DNS Server
If the two domain names are managed on a non-Tencent Cloud platform, the DNS servers of the domain name need to be modified so that they point to the address specified by the corresponding package. The DNS addresses of each package are as follows:
#### Free Edition
f1g1ns1.dnspod.net
f1g1ns2.dnspod.net
> Corresponding to 6 servers

#### Personal Professional Edition
ns3.dnsv2.com
