## Use Cases of Intelligent Resolution Lines

Generally, resolution is only responsible for resolving the IP record for the user, but not for determining where the user is coming from. This will cause all users to be resolved to a fixed IP address. In contrast, intelligent resolution determines the user's origin and then returns the IP after intelligent processing to the user. For example, it can check whether the user's Internet connection is from China Unicom or China Telecom, and then intelligently returns the IP of the corresponding server.

### 2. Note for Region- and ISP-specific Line Usage
For example, if the **default** line is set to be resolved to 8.8.8.8, the **Guangdong** line to 9.9.9.9 and the **China Telecom (Guangdong)** line to 10.10.10.10 for `cloud.tencent.com`, then the IP address 10.10.10.10 will be returned for users of China Telecom (Guangdong), 9.9.9.9 for non-China Telecom users in Guangdong and 8.8.8.8 for users outside Guangdong.
At this time, if the resolution for the China Telecom (Guangdong) line or the Guangdong line is suspended, the resolution for China won't be affected, and 8.8.8.8 will be returned for all users. **Therefore, no matter whether you add region- or ISP-specific lines, you must first add the **default** resolution line.**

### 3. Note for Search Engine-specific Line Usage
For search engine lines, you can configure spiders of Baidu, Google and other engines to capture different IP addresses. For example, if the **default** line is set to be resolved to 8.8.8.8, the **Baidu** line to 9.9.9.9 and the **Sogou** line to 10.10.10.10 for `cloud.tencent.com`, then the IP address 10.10.10.10 will be returned for users who visit the website by searching with Sogou, 9.9.9.9 for Baidu and 8.8.8.8 for users who directly visit the website.

>**Note:**
> The **Search engine** line is an aggregated line for the collection of search engines such as Baidu and Google.
