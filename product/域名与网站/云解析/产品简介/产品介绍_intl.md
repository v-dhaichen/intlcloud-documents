### What Is DNS?
After you register a domain name, you only own it but cannot directly access your website through it or use it as an email address suffix to send and receive emails. Domain name resolution (DNS) is a necessary step for accessing domain names. People are used to remembering domain names, but machines only recognize IP addresses. There is a one-to-one correspondence between a domain name and an IP address, and the conversion between them is called DNS which needs to be completed by a dedicated DNS server. The resolution process is automatic. DNS translates a domain name (for example, cloud.tencent.com) into a machine-readable IP address (for example, 10.10.10.10).
