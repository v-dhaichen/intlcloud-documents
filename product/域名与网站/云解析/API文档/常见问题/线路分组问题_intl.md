### Is line grouping available to the free edition?
Line grouping is available to the paid editions only. If you need to use this feature, please upgrade your domain name resolution package first.
 
### Why can't I see some domain names when I try to copy an existing domain name?
Only domain names that are grouped can be copied. Plus, only the grouping of a low-level domain name can be copied for a high-level domain name.

### Why can't I select a line for adding?
Each line can be added to only one line group. It is possible that the line has been added to another line group. If you need to add it, please remove it from that group first.

A line group name cannot be the same as the names of default or custom lines.
 
### How many line groups can I set for each resolution package?

### How many lines can I add to a line group?

### What can I do if I can't delete a group?
Only a group that is not in use can be deleted. You can modify the line of the resolution record or delete it first.
 
### What is the priority of resolution?
The resolution priority is as follows: **Independent line** > **Custom line group** > **Default group** > **Default**.
