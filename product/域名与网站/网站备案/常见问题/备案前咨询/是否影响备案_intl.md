### Does server change affect ICP filing?
Yes. It largely depends on if the new IP is from the same service provider.
When changing the IP address for ICP filing, please note:
1. If your IP is changing from Alibaba Cloud to us, please transfer your ICP filing to us, and vice versa.
2. If you have a Tencent Cloud IP and wish to change to another Tencent Cloud IP, operational ICP license may be required.
A. If operational ICP license is required, you need to apply for ICP filing information change and fill in the new IP address for ICP filing to make sure that the IP in the operational ICP license is the same as the IP registered with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT);
B. If operational ICP license is not required, you do not need to apply for ICP filing information change, as ICP filing change is not mandatory in case of IP change within the same access provider. Instead, you can submit the new IP when changing other ICP filing information.
### What will happen to my ICP filing application if I haven't completed identity verification for my domain name?
You can submit an ICP filing application even if you haven't completed identity verification for your domain name, but only domain names that pass identity verification can be approved.
### What will happen to my ICP filing application if the identity-verified user types for domain name and ICP filing are different?
The identity-verified user types for domain name and ICP filing must be the same; otherwise, your application will be rejected.
### If my website obtained ICP filing before but is no longer in use, can I apply for ICP filing for new website?
Different provincial Communications Administration Bureaus have different rules for verifying information of filed website. For details, see [Provincial Communications Administration Bureaus Filing Requirements](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1022/31671).

Identity document expiration will lead to rejection of your ICP filing application.
