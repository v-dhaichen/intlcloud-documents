### What is the difference between cancellation of website ICP filing transfer and deregistration of ICP filing?

- Cancellation of website ICP filing transfer is to unlink your ICP filing from Tencent Cloud. After that, Tencent Cloud will no longer be your access service provider, and the canceled domain names cannot point to Tencent Cloud servers for access. However, the ICP filing number of the website issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) still exists, and you should contact your new server provider and submit an application for ICP filing transfer as soon as possible; otherwise, the ICP filing information of your website may be deregistered by Communications Administration Bureaus.
- Deregistration of ICP filing is to delete the ICP filing information of your website from MIIT's system, and a re-application for ICP filing is required before the website can be accessed normally.

### My order's status is "application abandoned". Will it affect other ICP filings?

No. The status means your latest ICP filing information is abandoned and it does not affect other ICP filings already obtained.

### After my entity is deregistered, will it be deregistered from MIIT too?

Yes. After your entity is deregistered, the ICP filing number cannot be found in MIIT's system. 

### Can I cancel my deregister application?

- Yes, if the application has not been submitted to the Communications Administration Bureaus.
- No, if the application has already been submitted to the Communications Administration Bureaus.

### Does website deregistration affect the usage of other websites under the same entity?

The deregistration of a website only deletes the ICP filing information of the website and does not affect the normal use of other filed websites owned by the same entity. 

### Is my website accessible after ICP filing transfer cancellation?

- Cancellation of website ICP filing transfer is to unlink your ICP filing from Tencent Cloud. After that, domain names pointing to Tencent Cloud cannot be accessed any longer.
- The ICP filing number of the website issued by MIIT still exists, and you should contact your new server provider and submit an application for ICP filing transfer as soon as possible so as to avoid any impact on the normal use of your website.
