### Overview
There are tens of millions of servers on the Internet, and each server is assigned an IP address to be distinguished from one another. However, the meaninglessness of an IP address makes it hard to be remembered, so a domain name is used instead.
A domain name, comprised of letters, numbers, "-", ".", and other symbols, is an easy-to-remember server address (such as website, email and FTP) designed for better communication.
A domain name corresponds to an IP. A specialized domain name server (DNS) on the internet is used to translate a domain name to an IP. When you enter a domain name in your browser, DNS will translate it into an IP to locate an appropriate server and open the requested page.
You must register a domain name before you can establish a server on the internet to publish information. Since you have to apply for and register a domain name first, every registered domain name is unique on Tencent Cloud. It is recommended that you register a domain name as soon as possible.

### Types of Domain Name 
There are mainly two types of domain names: top-level domain name and ordinary domain name.

A top-level domain name refers to the domain name which contains only 3 segments of strings after the identifier "http://", such as `http://www.qq.com` and `http://cloud.tencent.com`. Segments are separated by dots. "www" stands for "World Wide Web", "qcloud" refers to Tencent Cloud, and "com" means a commercial company.
Top-level domain names are divided into international ones and domestic ones:
* International top-level domain names are also called international domain names, which are the earliest and most widely used domain names. For example, ".com" (for companies and enterprises), ".net" (for network services), and ".org" (for non-profit organizations).
* Domestic top-level domain names are also called domestic domain names, which are assigned different suffixes according to their country/region. For example, ".cn" (China), ".us" (USA), and ".jp" (Japan).

An ordinary domain name refers to the domain name which contains 4 segments of strings after the identifier "http://", such as `http://www.qq.com.cn` and `http://cloud.tencent.com.cn`.

### Domain Name Registration
You can purchase a domain name for a one-year or multi-year usage period, which is called domain name registration. According to the international practice, you must apply for and register a domain name first. A domain name is unique and only corresponds to one server. A domain name that has already been registered belongs to the applicant within the registration period, unless he/she cancels it or transfers the ownership. Therefore, it is recommended that you register your domain name as soon as possible. The registration process is shown below:
