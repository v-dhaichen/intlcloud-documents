### Deployment Steps
1. Modify the toa_win.conf file as instructed below: 
<table>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th><th>Required</th><th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ToaWinPort</td><td> Yes </td><td> This is the service port of toa_win.exe. It is used to communicate with TOA obtaining program. The default is 9999.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NetworkCardIP</td><td> Yes </td><td> This is used to identify the IP address of the network interface, for example, 10.75.132.39. This is the NIC that communicates with the clientâ€™s NIC.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ServerListenIP</td><td> Yes </td><td> This is the IP address of the server, for example, 10.75.132.39. It is used to filter TCP flows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ServerListenPortList</td><td> No </td><td> This is the port list of the server. It is used to filter TCP flows. At most 3 ports can be added.<br><b> Either ServerListenPortList or PortRange must be configured.</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PortRange</td><td> No </td><td> This is the port range of the server. It is used to filter TCP flows. 3 port ranges can be added at most.<br><b> Either ServerListenPortList or PortRange must be configured.</b></td>

2. Modify program_auto_up.bat.
Modify the path to the directory where the program is located. Add the script to the scheduled task, and execute it periodically. The script is used to monitor the toa_win.exe program and automatically activate the program when it exits.

3. Run the toa_win.exe program. The log is saved to toa_win.log in the same directory. Now, you can get the real IP address from TOA service through UDP communication. For details, see [Operation Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/608/17670).
