A root account or other accounts with AdministratorAccess permissions can assign collaborator accounts with GAAP read-write or read-only access permission by configuring access management permissions.

There are two ways the user can authorize the collaborator account: by associating a policy with a user, or by associating a user with a policy. For more information, see [Cloud Access Management (CAM)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10583).

2. In the top navigation, select **Cloud Products** > **Manage and Audit** > **[Cloud Access Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/policy)** to enter the CAM console.
