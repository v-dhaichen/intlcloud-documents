### What problems can be solved by GAAP?
GAAP helps vendors create high-speed network connections between end users and service servers, resolving cross-regional latency and stutter issues.

### What is the coverage of GAAP?
GAAP boasts more than 50 global nodes, covering Asia, Europe, South America, North America, and Oceania. It provides stable and efficient high-speed connection for businesses across the globe that require cross-region access or server sharing to avoid stutter and high latency in service access.

### How does GAAP work? 
A peering connection between the acceleration region and the origin region is set up, so users can avoid unstable public networks by using Tencent Cloudâ€™s global high-speed private network and optimized access routing. Direct business access through high-speed connections ensures fast and stable user experience.

### What is an acceleration region and an origin region?
- Acceleration region refers to the region where the user is located.
- Origin region refers to the region where the server is located. 

For example, your server is located in Hong Kong, and you want users from multiple locations (including the U.S. West Coast, U.S. East Coast, Japan, and Korea) to simultaneously access the Hong Kong server with high-speed connections, and you want the users to have fast and stable access experience. In this case, the acceleration region is the U.S. West Coast, U.S. East Coast, Japan, and Korea, while the origin region is Hong Kong.

### What protocols and forwarding methods are supported by GAAP?
GAAP supports Layer-4 and Layer-7 protocols. UDP/HTTP/HTTPS protocols, and IP, domain name forwarding are also supported.

### Does GAAP enable the origin server to get the real IP of the access user?
GAAP enables the origin server to get the real IP of the access user.

### What are some GAAP application scenarios?
GAAP can be used for cross-region business access, such as global e-commerce and global video game servers. For details, see [Use Cases](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/608/13760).

### What should be done if a collaborator account does not have permission to access GAAP?
Please contact the administrator of the root account or another account that has AdministratorAccess permissions to assign the collaborator with GAAP read-write or GAAP read-only access permission in [Configure Permissions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/608/31510).
