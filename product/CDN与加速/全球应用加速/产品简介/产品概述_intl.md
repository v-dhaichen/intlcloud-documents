## Overview
Tencent Cloud Global Application Acceleration Platform (GAAP) uses high-speed connections, cluster forwarding, and intelligent routing among global nodes to allow users in different regions to access the closest nodes so their requests can directly reach the origin server through high-speed connections, reducing access lag and latency.
GAAP provides graphical configuration interface. Within a few minutes, you can create a high-speed connection, use it to access business origin servers, and view the running status of the connection in the console.

## Product Advantages
### Global Deployment
GAAP has more than 50 global nodes deployed across Asia, Europe, South America, North America, and Oceania. It provides stable and efficient high-speed connections for businesses around the globe that require cross-region access or server sharing, reducing access lag and latency.

### High stability and efficiency
GAAP has five central nodes covering major regions around the world with a linkage stability of 99.95%. The network latency is below 60ms for intra-region communications and below 180ms for cross-continent or cross-region communications. A single GAAP connection can sustain 1 Gbps bandwidth and accelerate one million concurrent requests.

### Flexible Access
GAAP provides graphical user interface for easy creation and use of high-speed connections. It supports IP and domain name access, nearby access through globally unified domain name, TCP and UDP protocols, and URL rule forwarding for HTTP and HTTPS.

### OPS Support
GAAP supports the origin server to get real user IPs. It supports on-demand capacity expansion and service change imperceptible to your business; statistical analysis in multiple dimensions such as bandwidth, concurrence, packet loss, latency, and packet forwarding; cloud monitoring alarms for connections and origin servers.
