## One Server Shared by Game Players across the Globe
Some of our games are provided for players across the world or in a certain region. When many players play a game at the same time, network differences in various regions can lead to bad user experience and unfairness in games. GAAP supports access with a unified domain name from multiple regions, enabling players in different regions to connect a high-speed connection closest to them. In this way, acceleration is implemented simultaneously for players across the world or in the same region, which improves user experience and ensures fairness in the game.

## Cross-origin Access Acceleration
For businesses requiring cross-origin access, different network conditions of regions often result in increased delay and packet loss, and consequently affect user experience in accessing the business. GAAP can create high-speed connections between the acceleration region (region where the user is located) and the origin server region (region where the server is located), which can effectively reduce network latency and packet loss and ensure fast and stable network, and thus deliver better user experience.
Such business scenarios include transnational websites, cross-border e-commerce, Apps launched globally, global LVB, video, and global finance.
