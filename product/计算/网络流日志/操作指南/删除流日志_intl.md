Flow Logs allows full-time, full-flow and non-intrusive capture of ENI traffic for the real-time storage and analysis of network traffic, helping you deal with troubleshooting, compliance audit, architecture optimization and security testing and making your cloud network more stable, secure and intelligent. These services will be unavailable if you delete flow logs. The steps of deleting network flow logs are as follows:
1. Log in to [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/), and select **Products** -> **Cloud Compute & Network** -> [**Virtual Private Cloud**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc) -> **Flow Logs**.
2. Select the flow log to be deleted, and click **Delete**.
