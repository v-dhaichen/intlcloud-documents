## Operations Guide for RIs

Currently, RIs can be created and used only via APIs.

1. View the RIs that you can purchase. For more information, see [purchasable RI listing API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/30575)

2. Purchase RIs. For more information, see [RI purchasing API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/30574)

3. View the RIs you have purchased. For more information, see [purchased RI listing API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/30576)

4. Purchase pay-as-you-go instances that have exactly the same attributes as the Ris. For more information, see [instance creating API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/15730) or log in to the console

   > Note: RIs will be matched with pay-as-you-go instances with exactly the same attributes created before or after the RIs take effect

### Directions
