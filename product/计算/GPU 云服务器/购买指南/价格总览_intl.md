## Billing

**Pay-per-use**: Fees are charged every hour on the hour with no need to pay in advance.
A GCC instance includes network, storage (system disk and data disk), and hardware (CPU, memory, and GPU).

- The peak computing capacity of a single GN8.3XLARGE112: over 24 TFLOPS for single-precision floating point computing and over 94 TOPS for integer computing (INT8)

- The peak computing capacity of a single GN8.7XLARGE224: over 48 TFLOPS for single-precision floating point computing and over 188 TOPS for integer computing (INT8)

- The peak computing capacity of a single GN8.14XLARGE448: over 96 TFLOPS for single-precision floating point computing and over 376 TOPS for integer computing (INT8)


## Renewal
- A GCC instance is shut down on the expiry date and put into the recycle bin automatically. It will be retained for 7 calendar days during which you can choose to renew it. The instance is terminated if it is not renewed within 7 calendar days.
- You can set auto renewal for it when purchasing an instance.

You are recommended to renew an instance before its expiration to avoid service interruption caused by a shutdown when it expires. For more information on renewal, see [How to Renew](/document/product/560/8052).
## Reclaiming
 GPU instances are reclaimed in the same way as with CVM instances. For more information, see CVM [Instance Reclaim](/doc/product/213/4931#.E5.AE.9E.E4.BE.8B.E5.9B.9E.E6.94.B6).

## Arrears
GCC instances in arrears are in the same way as with CVMs in arrears. For more information, see CVM [Arrears](/document/product/213/2181).

The above price is the standard published price. For price changes caused by price reduction activities or other factors, see the purchase page.
