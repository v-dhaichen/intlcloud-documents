### 3. Select an image

**Note:**
**GCC instances can only operate normally with a compatible GPU driver.**

- If you install a public image, a created GCC instance can function normally only when the GPU driver is installed. For more information on driver installation, see [How to Install NVIDIA Driver](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/560/8048)


 After the configuration, click **Next Step: Select Storage and Network**.

### 4. Select storage and network
In this step, you must select:
- Storage: You can customize the type and size of a system disk and data disk as needed.
	1. System disk: HDD cloud disk/SSD cloud disk/local SSD.
	2. Data disk: HDD cloud disk/Premium cloud storage (those in the whitelist can be purchased)/SSD cloud disk/local SSD.
- Network: Select the network type (basic network or VPC) and public network bandwidth (charge by fixed bandwidth or by traffic usage).
	1. Network type:
		(1) Basic network: Suitable for new users. CVMs of the same user are interconnected via private network.
		(2) VPC: Suitable for advanced users. Different VPCs are logically isolated from each other.
	2. Public network bandwidth:
		(1) Bill-by-bandwidth: Select a fixed bandwidth. Packet loss occurs if this bandwidth is exceeded. This is suitable for scenarios with minor network fluctuation.
		(2) Bill-by-traffic: The service is charged based on actual traffic usage. You can set a limit for peak bandwidth. Packet loss occurs when the instantaneous bandwidth exceeds this limit (suitable for scenarios with large network fluctuations).
- Configure instance quantity and purchased usage period.

After the configuration, click **Next Step: Configure Information**

### 6. Check the instance
After the payment is made, go to the [Console](https://console.qcloud.com/cvm) to check the purchased instance in your mailbox.
When a GCC instance is purchased, you will receive an internal message containing instance information, such as instance name, public IP address, private IP address, login name, and initial login password. You can use these information to log in to and manage your instance. To ensure the security of your CVM, change your login password as soon as possible.
