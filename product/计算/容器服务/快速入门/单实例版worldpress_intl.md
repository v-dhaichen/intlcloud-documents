WordPress is a blogging platform developed with PHP. You can use it as a content management system, or use it to create websites on services that support PHP and MySQL databases.

This document describes how to use the `tutum/wordpress` image to create a publicly accessible WordPress website.

>**Note:**
>The created WordPress with single pod is for testing purpose only. The image includes all operating environments for WordPress, allowing you to pull and create the service directly. However, using WordPress with single pod cannot ensure persistent data storage, so it is recommended that you use the self-built MySQL or Tencent Cloud CDB to store your data. For more information, please see [WordPress with CDB](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/7447).

## Prerequisites
You need to create a cluster first. For more information on how to create a cluster, please see [Basic Operations of Cluster](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/9091).

## Procedure
1. Log in to the [Tencent Cloud TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ccs).
2. Click **Service** in the left navigation bar, and click **+ New** in the service list page.
