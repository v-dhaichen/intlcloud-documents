## Network Policy

A [network policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) is a resource provided by K8s to define pod-based network isolation policy. It specifies whether a group of pods is allowed to communicate with other groups of pods and other network endpoints.

## Kube-router

- Official website: [https://www.kube-router.io](https://www.kube-router.io)
- Project address: [https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router)

The latest version of Kube-router is 0.2.0.

It has three main features:

- Pod Networking
- IPVS/LVS-based service proxy  
- Network Policy Controller 

In TKE, Pod Networking is implemented by a high-performance pod network based on VPC at the IaaS layer, and service proxy is provided by the ipvs and iptables modes supported by kube-proxy. We recommend using only the Network Policy feature in TKE.

## Deploying Kube-router in TKE

### Kube-router Versions Provided by Tencent Cloud

The Kube-router image `ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/library/kube-router:v1` used in the YAML file below is provided by the Tencent Cloud PaaS team. It is created based on the 2018-07-29 commit "e2ee6a76" in the community and two bug fixes by the Tencent Cloud PaaS team (both of which have been merged by the community):

- [https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/488](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/488)
- [https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/498](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/498)

We regularly track the project progress in the community to provide version upgrades.

### Deploying Kube-router

Daemonset YAML file: [#kube-router-firewall-daemonset.yaml.zip#](https://ask.qcloudimg.com/draft/982360/90i1a7pucf.zip)

On a computer that can access both the internet and the TKE cluster apiserver, run the following commands to deploy Kube-router

If public IP access is enabled for a cluster node, you can run the following commands directly on the node.

Otherwise, manually download and paste the YAML file content to the node, save it as kube-router-firewall-daemonset.yaml, and run the final `kubectl create` command.

```
wget https://ask.qcloudimg.com/draft/982360/90i1a7pucf.zip
unzip 90i1a7pucf.zip
kuebectl create -f kube-router-firewall-daemonset.yaml
```

## NetworkPolicy Configuration Example

1. The pods in the nsa namespace can access one another and cannot be accessed by any other pods.
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: npa
  namespace: nsa
spec:
  ingress: 
  - from:
    - podSelector: {} 
  podSelector: {} 
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```

2. The pods in nsa namespace cannot be accessed by any pods.
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: npa
  namespace: nsa
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```

3. The pods in the nsa namespace can only be accessed by pods under the namespace with the tag app: nsb on the 6379/TCP port and cannot be accessed by any other pods.
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: npa
  namespace: nsa
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nsb
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 6379
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```

4. The pods in nsa namespace can access the 5978/TCP port of the network endpoint with CIDR of 14.215.0.0/16 but cannot access any other network endpoints (this method can be used to configure a whitelist for in-cluster services to access external network endpoints).
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: npa
  namespace: nsa
spec:
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 14.215.0.0/16
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5978
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
```

5. The pods in default namespace can only be accessed by the network endpoint with CIDR of 14.215.0.0/16 on the 80/TCP port but not by any other network endpoints.
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: npd
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 14.215.0.0/16
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```

### Annex. Test Cases

| Test Case | Test Result |
|:----|:----|
| Pods in different namespaces are isolated from one another, and pods in the same namespace can intercommunicate | Pass |
| Pods in the same and different namespaces are isolated from one another | Pass |
| Pods in different namespaces are isolated from one another, and B can access A as specified in the whitelist | Pass |
| The specified namespace can access the specified CIDR outside the cluster, and all other external IPs are blocked | Pass |
| Pods under different namespaces are isolated from one another, and namespace B can access the corresponding pods and port in namespace A as specified in the whitelist | Pass |
| In the test cases above, when the source pod and the destination pod are in the same node, the isolation takes effect | Fail |

## Performance Test Scheme

A large number of Nginx services are deployed in the K8s cluster, and a fixed service is measured with ApacheBench (ab). The QPS values in Kube-router-enabled and Kube-router-disabled scenarios are compared to measure the performance loss caused by Kube-router.

### Testing Environment

Number of VMs: 100

VM configuration: 2-core 4 GB

VM OS: Ubuntu

K8s: 1.10.5

Kube-router version: 0.2.0 

### Test Process

1. Deploy 1 service corresponding to 2 pods (Nginx) as the test group;

2. Deploy 1,000 services with each of them corresponding to 2/6/8 pods (Nginx) as the interference group;

3. Deploy a NetworkPolicy rule so that all pods are selected to produce a sufficient number of iptables rules:
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: npd
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 14.215.0.0/16
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 9090
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 14.215.0.0/16
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 14.215.0.0/16
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```

4. Use ab to test the service in the test group and record the QPS.

### Performance Curve

![kube-router.png](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/0c7b555e16cb115c9ffddcf66071b0b0.png)

X axis: ab concurrency

Y axis: QPS

### Test Conclusion

As the number of pods goes up from 2,000 to 8,000, the performance when Kube-router is enabled is 10%-20% lower then when it is disabled.
