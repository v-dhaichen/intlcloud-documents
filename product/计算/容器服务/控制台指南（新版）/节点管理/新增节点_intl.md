### Creating a Node

1. In the left sidebar, click **[Clusters](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster)** to go to the cluster management page.
2. In the row of the cluster for which to create a CVM instance, click **Create a node**.
3. On the "Select a model" page, select the billing method, availability zone, node network, and instance type based on actual needs. See the figure below:

4. Click **Next**.
5. On the "CVM configuration" page, configure the CVM instance. See the figure below:
![CVM configuration](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/1f1f16a958132f4b91923dfbc0f5f2ad.png)
Main parameters include:
 - OS: Select based on actual needs.
 - System disk: Select local disk, HDD cloud disk, premium cloud disk, or SSD cloud disk based on actual needs.
 - Data disk: Select based on actual needs.
 - Public network bandwidth: Select "Bill-by-bandwidth" or "Bill-by-traffic" based on actual needs.
 - Instance name:
    - Automatic naming: The CVM instance will be automatically named in the format of ccs_cluster id_node.
    - Manual naming: Enter a custom instance name of up to 60 characters.
 - Login method:
    - Set a password: Set a corresponding password as prompted.
    - Associate a key now: A key pair is a pair of parameters generated by an algorithm. It is a way to log in to a CVM instance more secure than regular passwords. For details, see [SSH Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/6092).
    - Generate a password automatically: A password will be automatically generated and sent to you through internal message.
 - Security group: Used to set the network access control of the CVM instance. Please select based on actual needs. You can also click **Create a security group** to open other ports to the internet.
6. Click **Next**.
7. On the "Information confirmation" page, confirm the selected configuration information, set the number of CVM instances, and click **Finish**.

### Adding an Existing Node

 Currently, you can only add CVM instances in the same VPC.

1. In the left sidebar, click **[Clusters](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster)** to go to the cluster management page.
2. In the row of the cluster for which to add an existing node, click **Add an existing node**. See the figure below:

3. On the "Select a node" page, select the node to be added and click **Next**.
4. On the "CVM configuration" page, configure the CVM instance to be added to the cluster.
Main parameters include:
 - Data disk settings: Select "Store containers and images in the data disk".
    - Do not set: Do not set the storage path of containers and images. If the system disk capacity is large enough, a CVM instance with no data disk is used, or the data disk needs to be manually mounted and used subsequently, it is recommended not to set the container directory.
    - Store containers and images in the data disk: If the system disk capacity is small, or a server with a data disk needs to accept data disk formatting, you can choose to set the storage directory of containers and images.
 - OS: Select based on actual needs.
 - Login method:
     - Set a password: Set a corresponding password as prompted.
    - Associate a key now: A key pair is a pair of parameters generated by an algorithm. It is a way to log in to a CVM instance more secure than regular passwords. For details, see [SSH Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/6092).
    - Generate a password automatically: A password will be automatically generated and sent to you through internal message.
 - Security group: Used to set the network access control of the CVM instance. Please select based on actual needs. You can also click **Create a security group** to open other ports to the internet.
5. Click **Finish**.
