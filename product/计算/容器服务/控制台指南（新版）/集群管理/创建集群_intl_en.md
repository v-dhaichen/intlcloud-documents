## Operation Scenario

When creating a cluster, you can use both new CVMs and existing CVMs as the initial nodes. This article guides you through these two cluster creation methods.

## Notes on the OS

- Change to the OS only take effect for newly added or reinstalled nodes, but not for existing nodes.
- Currently, you can only change an OS to one of the same type, for example, CentOS > CentOS-type custom image.
- To use the custom image feature, apply by [Submitting a Ticket](https://console.qcloud.com/workorder/category?level1_id=6&level2_id=350&source=0&data_title=%E5%AE%B9%E5%99%A8%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1TKE&level3_id=718&radio_title=%E5%AE%B9%E5%99%A8%E9%9B%86%E7%BE%A4%E7%9B%B8%E5%85%B3%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98&queue=97&scene_code=16798&step=2).

> If you use the custom image feature, create custom images based on the basic image provided by TKE.

## Directions

### Entering Cluster Information

1. <span id="step1">Log in to the [TKE Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2). </span>
2. In the left sidebar, click **[Clusters](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster?rid=1)** to go to the cluster management page.
3. On the cluster management page, click **Create**. this is shown in the following figure:
   ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/a160217b55e046ada478c85ab6018807.png)
4. On the **Create a Cluster** page, configure the basic information of the cluster. This is shown in the following figure:
   ![Create a Cluster](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/b8d43aae97612264127f29f0688ed71e.png)

- **Cluster Name**: The name of the cluster to be created, with a length limited to 60 characters.
- **Project**: Select based on actual needs. Newly added resources will be automatically assigned to this project.
- **Kubernetes Version**: Multiple Kubernetes versions are provided. For a comparison of the features of different versions, see [Supported Versions of Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/supported-doc-versions/).
- **Region**: Select the closest region based on your location. This helps minimize access latency and improve download speed.
- **Cluster Network**: Assigns an IP address that is within the node’s network address range to the CVMs in the cluster. For details, see [Container and Node Network Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/9083).
- **Container Network**: Assigns an IP address that is within the container’s network address range to the containers in the cluster. For details, see [Container and Node Network Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/9083).
- **Cluster Description**: Enter the information about the cluster, which will be displayed on the **Cluster Information** page.
- **Advanced Settings**: You can set IPVS.
  IPVS is suitable for scenarios where large-scale services are run in a cluster. It cannot be disabled after being enabled. For operation details, see [Enabling IPVS in a Cluster](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/30641).

5. Click **Next**.

## Selecting a Model

6. In **Select a Model**, determine whether to create a cluster using an existing CVM. This is shown in the following figure:
   ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/c2d68ba04ff80ba5a2ae8ba1da1f96b6.png)

- Check **Create a cluster using existing CVMs** if you want to [create a cluster using existing CVMs](#UseExistingCVMCreateCluster).
- Uncheck **Create a cluster using existing CVMs** if you [don’t want to use existing CVMs to create a cluster](#NotUseExistingCVMCreateCluster).

<span id="UseExistingCVMCreateCluster"></span>

#### Using an Existing CVM to Create a Cluster

> When using an existing CVM to create a cluster, you must pay attention to the following points:
>
> - The selected CVM must be reinstalled. After reinstallation, the data on the CVM system disk will be erased.
> - The selected CVM will be migrated to the project to which the cluster belongs.
> - Migrating a CVM to another project will cause the original security group to be unbound. You must rebind the security group.

7. In **Select a model**, select the deployment mode and model. This is shown in the following figure:
   ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/478e80eb5f5864d1dac10698c56a6dd2.png)
    Main parameters include:

- **Master**: The deployment method of `Master` determines the management mode for your cluster. We provide two cluster hosting modes you can choose from. For more information, see [Cluster Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/30635).
- **Node**: Node configured here is the worker node that is actually used by the cluster to run services. You can purchase a CVM as the node when you create the cluster, or you can add the node after the cluster creation.
- **Master&Etcd Model**: Select the CVM according to the following requirements.
  -The selected CVM must have at least 4-core CPU, and at least 3 CVMs must be selected.
  - The CVM cannot be the node of another TKE cluster.
  - The CVM status must be **Running**.
  - You can select across availability zones. 
- **Node Model**: This can be selected when **Node** is selected as **Add New**. You can also add a node after the cluster is created.

8. Click **Next**, [Configure the CVM](#ConfigureCVM).
