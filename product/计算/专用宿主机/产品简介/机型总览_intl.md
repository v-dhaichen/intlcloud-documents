CDH is a physical server equipped with a virtualized environment. Each model corresponds to the configuration of a different physical server, including the physical CPU model, number of CPU cores, memory size, local disk type, disk size and other hardware resources. You can choose the appropriate CDH model based on your business characteristics and size.

Currently, the following CDH models are supported:

| CDH configuration | Standard HS20 | Standard HS10 | High IO HI20 | High IO HI10 | MEM optimized HM20 | Compute HC20 |
