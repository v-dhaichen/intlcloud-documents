## Scenario

This guide introduces how to change public IP. There are two different ways:
- Change public IP directly
- First change to Elastic Public IP, and then unbind Elastic Public IP

**Note:**
If you change IP directly:
- At most 3 times/day per account per region.
- One instance can only change IP once.
- The previous IP will be released.

If you first change to Elastic Public IP and then unbind it:
- When Elastic IP is bound with an instance, the current public IP will be released.
- Elastic Public IP quota per account per region is 20.
- Release the unbound EIP as soon as possible if you no longer use it. Otherwise, you will be billed for the idle EIP. The released EIP cannot be retrieved. 

## Directions
### Change public IP directly
1. For an instance, click **More** > **IP/ENI** > **Change Public IP**.
