## Modifying the Name of an Instance

- Enter the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index), and select the CVM that needs to be renamed.
- Click **More** -> **Instance Settings** -> **Rename** on the page.
- On the renaming page, enter a new CVM name, and then click **OK**.

## Modifying Names of Multiple Instances
- Enter the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index), and select multiple CVMs that need to be renamed.
- Click **More actions** -> **Instance Settings** > **Rename** on the page.
- On the rename page, enter a new CVM name, and then click **OK**.

>Note: The names of multiple CVMs that are renamed by this way are the same.
