## 1. Terms and Definitions

Game Multimedia Engine (GME) Service provided by Tencent Cloud means the voice platform service provided by Tencent Cloud to you (“**Client**”), including without limitation real-time voice chat, voice messaging, audio-text conversion, audio filtering and other categories of audio services provided by Tencent Cloud Game Multimedia Engine. For details, please refer to the Service purchased by you and the content of Service provided by Tencent Cloud. You may achieve various voice features in an application through integrating SDKs provided by the Service.

Service Month(s): Service Month(s) means the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you. For example, if you purchase the Service for a term of three months starting from March 17, there will be four (4) Service Months (the first Service Month from March 17 to March 31, the second from April 1 to April 30, the third from May 1 to May 31, and the fourth from June 1 to June 16). The availability of the Service will be calculated independently for each Service Month.

Service Unavailable: For each one minute, if the number of users which are not able to use voice functions in the application within which you uses GME to achieve various voice functions exceeds 5% of the number of total users, the Service within such one minute shall be deemed unavailable.

Service Downtime: The aggregated minutes during which the Service is unavailable within a Service Month. Each minute is considered as one measurement point for GME service. The sum of the measurement points of which the Service is unavailable during a Service Month shall be the Service Downtime calculated in minutes for such Service Month.

 ## 2. Service Availability/ Service Success Rate

2.1. Calculation of Service Availability

Service Availability = (1 - Service Downtime calculated in minutes within a Service Month / total time of a Service Month calculated in minutes) × 100%

2.2. Service Availability/ Standard Indicator

The Service Availability of the Service provided by Tencent Cloud will be no less than 99.95%. You are entitled to the compensation as set forth in Section 3 below if the Service Availability fails to meet the aforementioned standard, other than in any circumstance as provided for in the release of liabilities provisions below.

If it takes less than 5 minutes for the Service to recover from malfunction, such period shall not be counted into Service Downtime. Service Downtime means the time period starting from the malfunction to the recovery back to normal use, which shall include the time period for maintenance.

## 3. Service Compensation

In respect of this Service, if the Service Availability fails to meet the aforementioned standard, you will be entitled to compensations in accordance with the following terms:

You cannot redeem such voucher for cash or request to issue an invoice for such voucher. Such voucher can only be used to purchase the Service by using your Tencent Cloud account. You cannot use the voucher to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the voucher to a third party for consideration or for free.

3.1.2. If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the standard, the amount of compensation will be calculated for such month independently, and the aggregate amount shall be no more than the applicable monthly service fee paid by you for such month (the monthly service fee referred herein shall exclude the portion deducted by a voucher or promotional credits, due to discounted service fee or otherwise deducted).

| Service    Availability for a Service Month | Value    of Compensation Voucher |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
