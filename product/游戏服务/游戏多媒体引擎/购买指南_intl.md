Game Multimedia Engine (GME) currently offers live voice chat, voice messaging and speech-to-text converter. See below for the rates.


## Live Voice Chat
Standard voice chat is billed by voice DAU. HD voice chat is billed by voice duration.

- We recommend standard sound quality for battle or casual games.
- We recommend HD sound quality for live voice broadcasting or online karaoke.
- For PCU billing, please contact our sales rep for details.
### Free Quota
There are free quotas for both billing methods of the live voice chat service.
- Billed by voice DAUs: free of charge if the daily DAU is below 100.
- Billed by voice duration: free of charge if the daily duration is below 300 minutes.

After reaching free quotas, fees apply based on your utilization.

> If an application has 150 minutes voice duration on a day, the service will be free of charge. If it has 1,000 minutes, the billable duration would be 1,000 minutes. Fee = 1,000 minutes * 0.94/1000 USD/minutes =  0.94 USD (based on the voice duration unit price of 0.94 USD/1,000 minutes).

- A voice DAU is counted when a user enters a room in the application. The total number of voice DAUs is based on deduplicated openIDs (openID is a unique user identifier in the application; one user is associated with one openID).
- Voice duration is calculated based on the time a user enters and exits the room. If user A enters a voice room at 12:00, user B enters the room at 12:30, and both of them exit the room at 12:40, the duration of voice use would be 50 minutes in total (40 minutes for user A and 10 minutes for user B).

## Voice Messaging and Speech-to-text Converter
Voice messaging and speech-to-text converter billings are based on voice message DAUs.
