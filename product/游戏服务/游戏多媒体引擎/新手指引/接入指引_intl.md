## Overview

Thank you for using [Tencent Cloud Game Multimedia Engine (GME) SDK](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/gme). This document describes how to access GME SDK to allow easier GME access for developers.

To use GME, follow the five steps below:
1. [Create a GME service in Tencent Cloud's backend](#.E6.96.B0.E5.BB.BA.E6.9C.8D.E5.8A.A1);
2. [Download the corresponding version of the client SDK](#.E4.B8.8B.E8.BD.BD-sdk);
3. [Port the SDK to the project by following the instructions in the API access document](#.E7.9B.B8.E5.85.B3-sdk-.E6.8A.80.E6.9C.AF.E6.96.87.E6.A1.A3);

## Downloading the SDK 
#### 1. Download address
Please download the relevant demo and SDK in the [SDK Download Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/18521).

#### 2. Preparations for access
To access the SDK, you need to use the appid and related permission keys provided by Tencent Cloud, which are the AppID in the application management list and the authentication information module in the application settings.

For more information on platform-specific configurations, see the corresponding project configuration document.

#### 3. Usage tips for the official demo

The demo has a Tencent cloud test account for functionality trial. If you need to use your personal or corporate test account, you need to replace the AppID of the Tencent Cloud test account in the corresponding interface of the demo with the AppID you obtain in the console and change the permission key of voice chat in the AVChatViewController-GetAuthBuffer function.
