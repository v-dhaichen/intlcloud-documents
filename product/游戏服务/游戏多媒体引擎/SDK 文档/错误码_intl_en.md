## Client Errors
| Error Name | Value | Description | Cause | Solution |
|--------|----|-------|--------------------|-------------------|
| AV_ERR_REPEATED_OPERATION | 1001 | Repeated operation | "An operation is performed when the same operation is in progress. Operation types include AVContext, room, device, and member. AVContext-related operations: StartContext/StopContext. Room-related operations: EnterRoom/ExitRoom. Device-related operations: start/shut down a device. Member-related operations: video image request/cancellation." | Perform next operation after the last operation is completed. |
| AV_ERR_EXCLUSIVE_OPERATION | 1002 | Exclusive operation | An operation is performed when another operation of the same type is in progress. | Perform next operation after the last operation is completed. |
| AV_ERR_HAS_IN_THE_STATE | 1003 | Repeated operation | An operation is performed to enable an object to enter a state when the object is already in the state. For example, when a client is already in a room, it performs an operation to enter the room again. | Regard the current operation result as successful because the object is already in the required state. |
| AV_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT | 1004 | Invalid parameter | One or more incorrect parameters are passed when an SDK API is called. For example, when a client is trying to enter a room, the input room type is not AVRoom::ROOM_TYPE_PAIR or AVRoom::ROOM_TYPE_MULTI. | Read the relevant API document carefully to get the valid value range for each parameter of each API. Take preventive measures to ensure the correctness of input parameters. |
| AV_ERR_TIMEOUT | 1005 | Timeout | The result of an operation is not returned within the specified time. This error occurs mostly when signaling is transmitted and the network has exceptions. For example, after a client performs an operation to enter a room, the result of the operation is not returned within 30 seconds. | Check whether the network is normal and whether the external network can be connected, and then try again. |
| AV_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED | 1006 | Not implement | The relevant feature has not been implemented when an SDK API is called. | Find other alternative methods. |
| AV_ERR_NOT_IN_MAIN_THREAD | 1007 | Not in the main thread | External SDK APIs must be called in the main thread, but a client does not call an SDK API in the main thread. | Modify the service logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called in the main thread. |
| AV_ERR_RESOURCE_IS_OCCUPIED | 1008 | Occupied resources | A required resource, such as the camera or screen, has already been occupied. | Identify the specific resources to be used and confirm the reason why these resources are occupied to ensure that SDK features are used at the right time without resource conflict. |
| AV_ERR_CONTEXT_NOT_EXIST | 1101 | Invalid AVContext status | When an AVContext object is not in the CONTEXT_STATE_STARTED status, a client calls an API that can be called only when the AVContext object is in the CONTEXT_STATE_STARTED status. | Modify the service logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_CONTEXT_NOT_STOPPED | 1102 | Invalid AVContext status | When an AVContext object is not in the CONTEXT_STATE_STOPPED status, a client calls an API that can be called only when the AVContext object is in the CONTEXT_STATE_STOPPED status. For example, a client calls AVContext::DestroyContext when an AVContext object is not in the CONTEXT_STATE_STOPPED status. | Modify the service logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_ROOM_NOT_EXIST | 1201 | Invalid AVRoom status | When an AVRoom object is not in the ROOM_STATE_ENTERED status, a client calls an API that can be called only when the AVRoom object is in the ROOM_STATE_ENTERED status. | Modify the service logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_ROOM_NOT_EXITED | 1202 | Invalid AVRoom status | When an AVRoom object is not in the ROOM_STATE_EXITED status, a client calls an API that can be called only when the AVRoom object is in the ROOM_STATE_EXITED status. For example, a client calls AVContext::StopContext when an AVRoom object is not in the ROOM_STATE_EXITED status. | Modify the service logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_DEVICE_NOT_EXIST | 1301 | The device does not exist. | A client uses a device that does not exist or has not been initialized. | Verify that the device exists, ensure that the device ID is entered correctly, and use the device after it is successfully initialized. |
| AV_ERR_ENDPOINT_NOT_EXIST | 1401 | The AVEndpoint object does not exist. | When a member has not initiated a voice chat or video chat, a client obtains the AVEndpoint object of the member. | Modify the service logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_ENDPOINT_HAS_NOT_VIDEO | 1402 | The member does not initiate a video chat. | When a member has not initiated a video chat, a client performs an operation that can be completed only after a video chat is initiated. For example, when a member has not initiated a video chat, a client requests the video image of the member. | Modify the service logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_TINYID_TO_OPENID_FAILED | 1501 | Failed to convert a tinyid into an identifier. | After receiving the signaling indicating a member's information update, a client needs to convert the relevant tinyid into an identifier. However, the conversion fails because the relevant logic of the IMSDK library or the network is exceptional. | Check whether the network is normal and check logs to confirm whether the relevant logic of the IMSDK library is normal. |
| AV_ERR_OPENID_TO_TINYID_FAILED | 1502 | Failed to convert an identifier into a tinyid. | When calling the StartContext API, a client needs to convert the relevant identifier into a tinyid. However, the conversion fails because the relevant logic of the IMSDK library or the network is exceptional, or the client is not in the login status. | Check whether the network is normal, check logs to confirm whether the relevant logic of the IMSDK library is normal and verify that the IMSDK login API has been successfully called. |
| AV_ERR_DEVICE_TEST_NOT_EXIST | 1601 | Invalid AVDeviceTest status | When an AVDeviceTest object is not in the DEVICE_TEST_STATE_STARTED status, a client calls an API that can be called only when the AVDeviceTest object is in the DEVICE_TEST_STATE_STARTED status. | Modify the service logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_DEVICE_TEST_NOT_STOPPED | 1602 | Invalid AVDeviceTest status | When an AVDeviceTest object is not in the DEVICE_TEST_STATE_STOPPED status, a client calls an API that can be called only when the AVDeviceTest object is in the DEVICE_TEST_STATE_STOPPED status. For example, a client calls AVContext::StopContext when an AVDeviceTest object is not in the DEVICE_TEST_STATE_STOPPED status. | Modify the service logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_INVITE_FAILED | 1801 | Failed to send an invitation. | A failure occurs when a client tries to send an invitation. | The invitation module is used only for demonstration, and the invitation feature is not supported externally. So this error code can be ignored. |
| AV_ERR_ACCEPT_FAILED | 1802 | Failed to accept an invitation. | A failure occurs when a client tries to accept an invitation. | The invitation module is used only for demonstration, and the invitation feature is not supported externally. So this error code can be ignored. |
| AV_ERR_REFUSE_FAILED | 1803 | Failed to refuse an invitation. | A failure occurs when a client tries to reject an invitation. | The invitation module is used only for demonstration, and the invitation feature is not supported externally. So this error code can be ignored. |
| QAV_ERR_NOT_TRY_NEW_ROOM | 2001 | A client fails to enter a new room and remains in the original room. | A client fails to switch to a new room and remains in the current room. | Remain in the current room. |
| QAV_ERR_TRY_NEW_ROOM_FAILED | 2002 | A client attempts to enter a new room but fails, and exits the original room. | A client fails to switch to a new room and has exited the original room. | Enter a room again. |
