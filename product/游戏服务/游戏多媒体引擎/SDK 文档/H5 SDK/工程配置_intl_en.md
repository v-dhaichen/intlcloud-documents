## Overview

Thank you for using Tencent Cloud Game Multimedia Engine (GME) SDK. This document provides project configuration that makes it easy for H5 developers to debug and access the APIs for GME.

## Platforms Supported by H5 SDK

## SDK Preparation
You can obtain the SDK by the following steps:
1. Download applicable Demo and SDK from [Download Instructions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/18521).
2. Locate the SDK resource for H5 on the page.
3. Click **Download**.


## Preparations
### 1. Open ports
If you have configured a firewall for your network, make sure you've opened the following ports:

| Protocol | Port |
| ---- | ----------------- |
| TCP | 8687 |
| UDP | 8000, 8800, and 443 |

Introduce SDK using CDN.

### 2. Introduce WebRTCAPI.min.js

```
html
<script src="https://sqimg.qq.com/expert_qq/webrtc/3.0/WebRTCAPI.min.js"></script>
```

### 3. Configure H5 authentication
#### Download the program
[Download](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/b1d8e4d8e7321fd67250069d07bf2016.zip) the authBuffer program sample, which can sign the authentication information for the specified sdkappid.

#### Modify as required
Go to the signdemo directory and modify the config.js file: Open the config.js file, delete the default configuration, and call the appidMap function in the place where the code is deleted. The parameters are the SDKAppid applied in Tencent Cloud backend and the corresponding authentication key.

```
const AuthBufferConfig = function () {
    this.appidMap = {};
    this.appidMap["1400089356"] = "1cfbfd2a1a03a53e";
};
// Replace 1400089356 with the sdkAppid applied in Tencent Cloud backend, and replace 1cfbfd2a1a03a53e with the authentication key corresponding to the sdkAppid
```

> AuthKey must correspond to your sdkAppid.

#### Install and run npm package
Go to the directory where the authBuffer program sample resides, and execute the following statement to install the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Then, execute the script "node index.js" to run the signature service.

> As the async syntax is used, make sure your node is above version 8. Execute "node -v" in the command line to view the version.


#### Test
You can input the following command in the command line for test (make sure there is the curl command in the system):

```
// Generate userSig:
curl "http://127.0.0.1:10005/" --data "sdkappid=1400089356&roomid=1234123&openid=1234567"
```

#### Return sample
After executing the signature program, the signature program will return the authentication information, and the reference sample is as follows:

```
{"userSig":"AqhHE7QHLFYPfV/zfyrdRYHfuUn6eOA8g/J6GMjVy//Shr5ByJPTi8hzR2KyXMvn","errorCode":0}
```
