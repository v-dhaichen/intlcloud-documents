### What does the corporate security score mean?

Security score is a scoring system based on the comprehensive assessment of your current security risk profile (including vulnerabilities, trojans, brute force attacks and much more), which objectively reflects the current security level of your business.
### How is the Internet-wide security score calculated?

The Internet-wide security score is calculated based on the comprehensive evaluation of Tencent's big security data and the security index provided by China's National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team, which reflects the current security situation of the entire Internet.
### How does SOC's visual representation alert to risk events?

In the SOC Overview screen, the system responds to the detected risk events in real time and visually presents them to you (for example, the data center in Beijing has been under brute force attacks for 1 minute...).
### What impact does the brute force attack event seen on the SOC Overview page have on the security of my business?

A brute force attack event does not mean that the server is successfully cracked by hackers. Instead, a hacker is launching a brute force attack on the server which is successfully detected by Tencent Cloud security system.

### Why are there no data in many modules in the console?
