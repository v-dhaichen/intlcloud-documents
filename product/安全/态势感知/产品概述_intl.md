## What Is SOC?
Tencent Cloud Security Operations Center (SOC)(formerly known as Tencent Cloud Security Situation Awareness) is a big security data visualization platform that provides visibility into businesses, assets, threats and risks based on the customer's cloud security data and Tencent's massive security data. Through multi-dimensional, intelligent, continuous analysis of massive amounts of data, SOC helps identify potential internal and external risks and predict impending security threats.

## Main Features
### Security Events
SOC can monitor and audit various attacks such as DDoS attacks, web attacks, off-site logins and brute force attacks and detect trojan files.
