In order to meet the needs in various business scenarios, Aegis Anti-DDoS allows adjustment and upgrade of the base protection bandwidth and elastic protection of DDoS protective IP and DDoS protection pack.

## Adjusting Base Protection Bandwidth

### Fees Rules

- If the base protection is upgraded, extra fees will be charged, and the protection level can be upgrade but not downgraded.
- When upgrading the base protection bandwidth, you need to pay the price difference for the days before the expiry date. **To upgrade the base protection bandwidth, you should pay the price difference by the day: days of upgrade = resource expiry date - the current date; upgrade fees = monthly price difference for upgrade x days of upgrade x (365 / 12).**
- If the base protection bandwidth after adjustment exceeds the set elastic protection bandwidth, elastic protection will be disabled.
- Upgrade does not affect the resource expiry date.
- Upgrade can be paid for with vouchers and voucher amounts.

### Billing Example

The prices below are for example only but not listed prices at our official website. For the actual unit prices, see [Aegis Product Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/685).

 **Background**
 On October 4, 2017, you purchased one BGP DDoS protective IP (1-year, single-IP, East China) with a base protection bandwidth of 10 Gbps, an elastic protection bandwidth of 20 Gbps and bill-by-bandwidth traffic-forwarding at a prepaid unit price of USD559/month.

 **Case 1**

 On September 14, 2018, the base protection bandwidth was upgraded from 10 Gbps to 20 Gbps at the unit price of USD1079/month.
- Monthly price difference for upgrade = 1079 - 559 = USD520/month.
- Days of upgrade = 17 + 4 = 21 days. The expiry date is October 4, 2018, and there are 17 days from September 14 to September 30.
- Upgrade fees = (1079 - 559) x 21 / (365 / 12) = USD359.01.

## Adjusting Elastic Protection Bandwidth
