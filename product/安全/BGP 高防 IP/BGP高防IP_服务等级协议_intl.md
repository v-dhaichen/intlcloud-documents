##  1.**Terms and Definitions**

1.1 Anti-DDoS Advanced Service means the anti-DDoS service provided by Tencent Cloud for the anti-DDoS instance you purchased. For details, please refer to the Service purchased by you and the content of Service provided by Tencent Cloud.

1.2 **Service Unavailable**: The packet loss rate is higher than 20% or TCP connection success rate is less than 30% due to Anti-DDoS Advanced Service per se, which does not refer to the availability of the whole chain (such as client's source server's fully-occupied bandwidth or machine room failure).

1.3 **Service Downtime**: The aggregated minutes during which the Service is unavailable within a Service Month. Each minute is considered as one measurement point for Anti-DDoS Advanced service. The sum of the measurement points of which the Service is unavailable during a Service Month shall be the Service Downtime calculated in minutes for such Service Month.

1.4 **Service Month(s)**: Service Month(s) means the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you. For example, if you purchase the Service for a term of three months starting from March 17, there will be four (4) Service Months (the first Service Month from March 17 to March 31, the second from April 1 to April 30, the third from May 1 to May 31, and the fourth from June 1 to June 16). The availability of the Service will be calculated independently for each Service Month.

## 2.  **Service Availability/ Service Success Rate**

 **2.1  Calculation of Service Availability/Service Success Rate**

Service Availability = ((total time of a Service Month calculated in minutes - Service Downtime calculated in minutes within a Service Month) / total time of a Service Month calculated in minutes) × 100%

 **2.2 Service Availability/ Standard Indicator**

The Service Availability of the Service provided by Tencent Cloud will be no less than 99.9 %. You are entitled to the compensation as set forth in Section 3 below if the Service Availability fails to meet the aforementioned standard, other than in any circumstance as provided for in the release of liabilities provisions below.

## 3.  **Service Compensation**

In respect of this Service, if the Service Availability fails to meet the abovementioned standard, you will be entitled to compensations in accordance with the following terms:

**3.1 Standards of Compensation**

1.  Compensations will be made in the form of voucher by Tencent Cloud, and you should follow the rules for using the voucher (including the valid term; for details, please refer to the rules of vouchers published on Tencent Cloud's official website). You cannot redeem such voucher for cash or request to issue an invoice for such voucher. Such voucher can only be used to purchase the Service by using your Tencent Cloud account. You cannot use the voucher to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the voucher to a third party for consideration or for free.

2. If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the standard, the amount of compensation will be calculated for such month independently, and the aggregate amount shall be no more than the applicable monthly service fee paid by you for such month (the monthly service fee referred herein shall exclude the portion deducted by a voucher or promotional credit, due to discounted service fee or otherwise deducted).


  |Service Availability for a Service Month |  Value of Compensation Voucher|
  |--------| --------|
  |≥ 99% and \< 99.9% |                        10% of the monthly service fee|
  |≥ 95% and \< 99% |                          25% of the monthly service fee|
  |< 95%     |                                100% of the monthly service fee|

**3.2 Time Limit for Compensation Application**

  1. If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the abovementioned Service Availability standard, you may apply for compensation through (and only through) the support ticket system under your relevant account after the fifth (5<sup>th</sup>) business day of the month immediately following such Service Month. Tencent Cloud will verify and ascertain your application upon receipt of such application. If there is any dispute over the calculation of the Service Availability for a Service Month, both parties agree that the back-end record of Tencent Cloud will prevail.

  2. You should apply for such compensation no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the expiry of the applicable Service Month in which the Service Availability fails to meet the standard. If you fail to make any application within such period, or make the application after such period, or make the application by any means other than that agreed herein, it shall be deemed that you have voluntarily waived your right to apply for such compensation and any other rights you may have against Tencent Cloud, in which case Tencent Cloud has the right to reject your application for compensation and not to make any compensation to you.


**3.3 Compensation Application Materials**

If you believe that the Service fails to meet the Standards of Service Availability, you may submit the compensation application within the period set forth in this SLA. Your compensation application shall be submitted along with the following documents:

  1)  A detailed incident description report;

  2)  Specific date, time, duration and other details relating to Service unavailability, cleaning time or portion of normal traffic;

  3)  If your compensation application is based on abnormal portion of normal traffic, the capture document evidencing the existence and amount of abnormal traffic lasting for at least one hour shall be provided;

  4)  Other information reasonably requested by Tencent Cloud.
