Maintenance is an important part of TencentDB for MongoDB management. To ensure the stability of your TencentDB for MongoDB instance, we recommend you set up a maintenance period (usually during off-peak hours to reduce the effects on service availability) for your instance. The back-end system will irregularly maintain your instance during this period.


### Set up instance maintenance period
1. Log in to the [Console of TencentDB for MongoDB](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mongodb/), On the Instance List specify the instance to update, and click **Management** on the **Operation** menu.
