To manage instances, TencentDB for MongoDB allows you to assign instances to different projects.

Notes:
- Re-assigning and moving instances to other projects do not affect service availability.
- You need to specify a project to which the new instance will be assigned. The default is **Default Project**.
- You can use the **Assign to Project** to re-assign the instance to another project.
