## Connection User Name
TencentDB for MongoDB comes with two default users: "rwuser" and "mongouser". The role for the built-in users is [readWriteAnyDatabase+dbAdmin](https://docs.mongodb.org/v3.0/reference/built-in-roles/). In other words, you only can read and write databases, but other critical operations are not permitted.
Depending on the version of TencentDB for MongoDB, some instances only have "rwuser" (Tencent Cloud will upgrade these instances and will contact you before the upgrades).
You can also use TencentDB for MongoDB Console for account and permission management to meet your business needs.

## Avoiding Filling Up Disk
Write operation will be denied when the instance disk is 100% occupied, so please adjust instance configuration in time according to your business needs.
