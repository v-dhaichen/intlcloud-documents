## Overview
TcaplusDB service APIs are used by apps to access TcaplusDB for data access and to store and acquire TcaplusDB App data for programming access. TcaplusDB mainly uses Google Protocol Buffer (Protobuf) as the communication and data element definition protocol.

## Process
After you activate the service and create a table in the console, you will see AppId, AppKey and private network access address on the configuration information page, as well as name of the created table and deployment unit ID (ZoneId) on the Protobuf table management page. The first three items are obtained after successful access to TcaplusDB, and the last two items are defined when the service creates a table structure on the TcaplusDB management page. With TcaplusDB service API, apps can operate multiple tables with an AppId.

## Module
You can define a table that meets TcaplusDB specifications with the Protobuf protocol and submit the metafile specific to the table to the TcaplusDB console to create a new table or modify an existing table. Then, you can read and write table data records through TcaplusDB Protobuf API. TcaplusDB Protobuf API supports the following operations:

| Operation | Description |
|---------|---------|
| GET | Get a Value based on a specific Key |
| BATCHGET | Get multiple Values based on multiple Keys |
| ADD | Add a data record. If a Key-related record already exists, an error will occur. |
| SET | If a Key-related record already exists, it will be updated. Otherwise, a new record will be added. |
| DEL| Delete a record based on a Key |
| FIELDINC | Add a value of a specified field (integer) |
| FIELDSET | Update (one or more) value(s) of a specific field |
| FIELDGET | Get (one or more) value(s) of a specific field |
| INDEXGET | Specify an index and field for query |
| TRAVERSE | Specify the table name for full table traversal |

## TcaplusDB SDK Conventions
TcaplusDB must define primary key and other information for the table. The extension tcaplusservice.optionv1.proto is built in the TcaplusDB system. When customizing a table, you just need to import a custom table to create a new table or modify an existing table without uploading a new one. Details are shown below:
```
extend google.protobuf.MessageOptions
{
    optional string tcaplus_primary_key             = 60000; //Define the primary key of the table
    repeated string tcaplus_index                   = 60001; //Define the index of the table
    optional string tcaplus_field_cipher_suite      = 60002; //Define encryption algorithm for table fields
    optional string tcaplus_record_cipher_suite     = 60003; //Define encryption algorithm for table fields. Currently not available..
    optional string tcaplus_cipher_md5              = 60004; //It is used to return a cipher key message digest.
    optional string tcaplus_sharding_key            = 60005; //Tcaplus sharding key
}

extend google.protobuf.FieldOptions
{
    optional uint32 tcaplus_size                    = 60000; //Field size. Currently not available..
    optional string tcaplus_desc                    = 60001; //Field description
    optional bool tcaplus_crypto                    = 60002; //Indicates whether to encrypt the field. Encryption algorithm is defined by tcaplus_field_cipher_suite.
}
```
The complete file can be found in the directory release\x86_64\include\tcaplus_pb_api\tcaplusservice.optionv1.proto.
1. The table name must start with letters or underscores (_), and cannot exceed 31 characters. Special characters other than numbers, letters and underscores (_) are not supported.
2. The field names should contain letters or underscores (_), which are further restricted by protobuf.
3. A table can contain up to 4 primary key fields and the field type must be REQUIRED. The length after packaging cannot exceed 1,022 bytes.
4. The packaged value size should not exceed 256 KB, and the complete record package size should not exceed 256 KB.
5. Other than the key field, there must be at least one value field. The upper limit of the value fields is specified by protobuf.
6. By default, the table type is generic. But the generic type is not displayed externally.
7. Currently, the key field can only be of scalar value type specified by protobuf, and cannot contain any composite types, custom types, etc.

## Rules and Restrictions
### Get restrictions
1. It cannot query records of a specific version.
