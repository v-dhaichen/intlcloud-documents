## Billing Rules
Daily cost of TcaplusDB = Daily capacity fees + Daily fees for reserved writes + Daily fees for reserved reads

## Glossary
Capacity: The names of both primary key column and attribute column are counted into the data size of each record line.

Reserved read: One 4 KB single-line read operation per second is one reserved read CU (capacity unit).

Reserved write: One 4 KB single-line write operation per second is one reserved write CU.

CU calculation rule: A CU is calculated separately at the end of each request and response process. CUs are accumulated and calculated according to the larger value between the request and the response. Data smaller than 4 KB is rounded up to the nearest 4 KB, and data larger than 4 KB is calculated in multiples of 4 KB. For example, if a 9 KB response is returned for a 1 KB request within a second, because the size of the response is larger than that of the request, the number of CUs is calculated according to the value of response. 9 KB is about two 4 KB sets, and the remaining 1 KB is counted as 4 KB, so the total number of CUs is 2+1=3.

## Billing Method
Postpaid.

>The capacity, reserved read and reserved write of a single table should be between 1 GB to 300 GB, 60 CUs to 800,000 CUs, and 20 CUs to 260,000 CUs, respectively. To apply for more quota, [contact customer service](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-sales) to sign an off-line contract.

- When you apply for the storage product, the system will calculate whether the balance in your account is sufficient. If it is sufficient, a specified amount (capacity*unit price) will be frozen for one day when you create a table; otherwise, the creation will fail.
- The fees of the previous day will be deducted daily at 00:00.
- Insufficient balance will trigger denial of access to the service. When your account is in arrears, data will be kept for 7 days. If you fail to make the payment within 7 days, the data will be deleted.

## Settlement Cycle
Fees are charged on a daily basis, and those generated in the current day will automatically be deducted on next day. Any bill-related dispute should be resolved through negotiation. When negotiation fails, the resolution shall be based on the system data.
