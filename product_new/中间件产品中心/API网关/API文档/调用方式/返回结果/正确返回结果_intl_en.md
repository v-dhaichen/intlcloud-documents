>**This is a legacy API and may be deprecated in the future. It is currently not displayed on the left sidebar. We recommend using [CVM API v3.0], which is more standardized and has much lower access latency (https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15689).**

If an API call succeeds, the `code` field in the final returned result will be 0. The `message` field is empty, and the returned result data is displayed.
Below is a sample:
```
{
    "code": "0",
    "message": ""
    <Returned result data>
}
```
