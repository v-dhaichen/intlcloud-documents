## Glossary
Below is the list of common terms used in this document:

| Term | Full Name | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Instance | Server instance | Message queue server is a logical concept and consists of many physical machines that provide services |
| Region | [Regions and Availability Zones](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/213/6091) | The region where resources are located. Each region contains multiple availability zones |
| Zone | [Availability Zone](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/213/6091) | Physical IDCs of Tencent Cloud with independent power and network resources within the same region [Regions and Availability Zones](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/213/6091). They are designed to ensure business stability as failures within an availability zone can be isolated without affecting other zones |
| Pay-as-you-go | Pay-as-you-go |A billing method. For more information, see [Billing Methods](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/213/2180#2.-.E6.8C.89.E9.87.8F.E8.AE.A1.E8.B4.B9) |

#### Definitions of Input and Response Parameters
* Limit and Offset
These parameters are used for paging control. "Limit" indicates the maximum number of entries returned at a time, and "Offset" is the offset value. If the number of results exceeds the Limit, the number of returned results equals to the value of Limit.
For example, if Offset=0 and Limit=20, the 0th to 19th entries are returned; if Offset=20 and Limit=20, the 20th to 39th entries are returned; if Offset=40 and Limit=20, the 40th to 59th entries are returned and so on.
	
* topic.N
Format for inputting multiple parameters at a time. The format below indicates an array parameter, which means multiple parameters can be input at the same time. The inputting format is: 
topic.0=test1&topic.1=test2&topic.2=test3, and so on (start with the subscript 0).


## Getting Started with APIs
The following describes some typical use cases for CKafka APIs:
- Create a topic by using the [CreateTopic](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/597/10096) API and providing required information such as instance ID, topic name, number of partitions, and number of replicas.
- To modify the configuration of a topic, use the [SetTopicAttributes] (https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/597/10098) API.

## Use Limits 
* CKafka allows up to 100 API calls per minute, and not more than 100 calls per minute for a single API.
* For information on specific limits, see documents for corresponding APIs or products.
