## API Description
This API is used to consume a message in the queue.
Calling the `ReceiveMessage` API will turn the status of the obtained message to `inactive`, and the period of being `inactive` is specified by the `visibilityTimeout` queue attribute (for more information, please see [CreateQueue API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/406/5832)). After successful consumption within the period of `visibilityTimeout`, you are recommended to call the `(batch) DeleteMessage` API to delete the message; otherwise, it will return to the `active` status and may be consumed again. This ensures that the message is consumed at least once, but cannot guarantee the idempotency. Therefore, deduplication logic is required at the business side.

- API public domain name: `https://cmq-queue-{$region}.api.qcloud.com`
- API private domain name: `http://cmq-queue-{$region}.api.tencentyun.com`
   
In the above domain names, **`{$region}` needs to be replaced with a specific region**: `gz` (Guangzhou), `sh` (Shanghai), `bj` (Beijing), `hk` (Hong Kong (China)), `cd` (Chengdu), `ca` (North America), `usw` (West US), or `sg` (Singapore). The value of `region` in the common parameters should be the same as that of `region` in the domain name; otherwise, the latter will prevail, i.e., requests will be sent to the region as specified by `region` in the domain name.
>Whenever downstream traffic is generated from using the public domain name, traffic fees will be charged (even during the beta test period). Therefore, you are strongly recommended to use the **private** domain name as traffic fees will not be incurred there.



## Input Parameters
The list below contains only the API request parameters. Other parameters can be found in [Common Request Parameters](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/6976).

| Parameter Name | Required | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| queueName | Yes | String | Queue name, which is unique under the same account in an individual region. It is a string of up to 64 characters, which must begin with a letter and can contain letters, digits, and dashes (`-`). |
| pollingWaitSeconds| No | Int | Long polling wait time in seconds. Value range: 0â€“30. If this parameter is not set, the value of `pollingWaitSeconds` in queue attributes will be used by default. |


## Output Parameters

| Parameter Name | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| code | Int | 0: success; others: error. For more information on errors, please see [Common Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/406/5903). |
| message | String | Error message. |
| requestId | String| Request ID generated by the server, which can be submitted to the backend for troubleshooting when an internal server error occurs. |
| msgBody | String| Body of the consumed message. |
| msgId | String| Unique ID of the consumed message. |
| receiptHandle| String| Unique message handler returned from each consumption, which is used to delete the message. Only a message handler generated from the last consumption can be used to delete the message. After successful consumption within the period of `visibilityTimeout`, you can use the handler to call the `(batch) DeleteMessage` API to delete the message. If `visibilityTimeout` has elapsed, the handler will become invalid. |
| enqueueTime | Int | Time when consumption is created and enters the queue. A Unix timestamp will be returned which is accurate down to the second. |
| nextVisibleTime | Int | Time when a message is visible next time (i.e., consumable again). A Unix timestamp will be returned which is accurate down to the second. |
| dequeueCount | Int | Reserved field. |
| firstDequeueTime | Int | Reserved field. |
