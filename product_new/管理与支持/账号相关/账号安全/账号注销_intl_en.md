# Account Cancellation

Once an account has been cancelled, it cannot be restored. In order to ensure that your account assets, cloud resources, account information, and so on, are not affected, backup all data under your account before you apply to cancel your account.

## Account Cancellation Process
### 1. Go to the Account Center
Go to [**Account Center** >**Security Settings**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer/security). In the account cancellation module, select **Cancel**.
### 2. Confirm the application to cancel the account
Before submitting the application, read the notes carefully.

### 3. Upload basic information materials
Users that have already undergone identity verification must upload the documents needed to verify their identity. Users that have not verified their identity do not need to perform this step and can proceed directly to the cancellation application review stage.
Documents needed for identity verified personal users:

- Passport or driverâ€™s license.

>Above scans must be in **color**.

Documents needed for identity verified enterprise users:
- Business identification.

>Above scans must be in **color**.



### 4. Review of the cancellation application
The review of the account cancellation application takes approximately 3 business days. You will be notified of the results through your secure phone number or email address. If you need to modify your secure phone number or email address, go to [**Account Center** > **Security Settings**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer/security).

### 5. Successful account cancellation
When the account has been cancelled successfully, you will be notified by SMS and email. After the account is cancelled, you will no longer be able to use this account to log in to the Tencent Cloud website.
