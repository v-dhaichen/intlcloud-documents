Login protection is an added layer of protection that Tencent Cloud provides when you log in. Users enter a credential for identity verification after the user name and password have been entered correctly.

When login protection is enabled, you must verify your identity every time you log in to the Tencent Cloud website. This prevents others from logging into your account, even if they steal your password.

## Enabling Login Protection
Log in to the Tencent Cloud Console. Go to [Security Settings](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer/security).  **Login Protection** can be enabled under **Account Protection Verification**.
