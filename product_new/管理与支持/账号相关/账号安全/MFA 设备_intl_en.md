Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a simple and effective security authentication method. It adds an additional layer of protection to strengthen the user name and password credentials. An MFA device, also called a dynamic password card or token, is a device that provides this type of secure authentication method. Tencent Cloud currently offers two types of MFA devices: hardware MFA devices and virtual MFA devices.


## Hardware MFA Devices
The figure below shows some examples of our hardware MFA devices. The 6-digit dynamic authentication code displayed is updated every 30 seconds, and the serial number of the MFA device is on the back. Currently this device is only available to beta users.
