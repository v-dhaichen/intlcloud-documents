HIPAA
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was enacted in 1996 in the United States. One of its purposes is to promote the use of electronic health records in order to improve the efficiency and quality of the healthcare system by strengthening information sharing. HIPAA also protects the security (including availability, integrity, and confidentiality) and privacy of Protected Health Information (PHI) during information creation, receipt, maintenance, and transfer by related entities and their business associates. HIPAA-covered entities and their business associates are required to take appropriate security measures when processing, maintaining, and storing PHI.
  For Tencent Cloud services, PHI is an electronic form which we refer to as electronic Personal Health Information (ePHI). ePHI contains a very wide range of health data and related data that can be used to identify individuals.
Tencent Cloud releases self-assessment reports for HIPAA compliance, which explain its ability to protect users' personal information and the effectiveness of the control measures taken.
