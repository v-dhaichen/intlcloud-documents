Tencent Cloud has achieved the Korean Information Security Protection Management System (K-ISMS) certification, proving that the information security management systems and capabilities developed by Tencent Cloud are in compliance with applicable Korean laws and standards.
The K-ISMS certification is a Korean government-backed certification sponsored by the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) and affiliated with the Korean Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT). It aims to help Korean organizations consistently and securely protect their information assets based on applicable Korean laws on information and communication technology. As a Korea-specific information security protection framework, K-ISMS defines a set of strict control requirements that cover asset management, access control, authentication and permission management, encryption, and disaster recovery, with a focus on auditing the security and reliability of organizations' management of key information assets, including organizational and personal information.
Achieving this certification means that Tencent Cloud customers in Korea can easily demonstrate adherence with local legal requirements to protect key digital information assets and meet KISA compliance standards with greater ease. This also reflects that Tencent Cloudâ€™s information security protection strategies and threat handling procedures effectively minimizes the impact of any security breaches.
