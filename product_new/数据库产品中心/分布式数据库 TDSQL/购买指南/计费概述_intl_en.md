## Billing Modes
TencentDB for  TDSQL offers the following billing modes:

| Billing Mode | Payment Mode | Application Scenario |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Pay as you go | In this postpaid billing mode, you can apply for resources for on-demand use and will be charged based on the actual usage at the billing time. | It is suitable for instantaneously fluctuating businesses. In this mode, instances can be released immediately after the use so as to reduce the costs. |

Depending on the usage duration, the prices in pay-as-you-go mode are divided into three tiers:

| Usage Duration | Tiered Pricing |
|---------|---------|
| 0 hours < duration ≤ 96 hours | Tier 1 pay-as-you-go price applies |
| 96 hours < duration ≤ 360 hours | Tier 2 pay-as-you-go price applies |
| Duration > 360 hours | Tier 3 pay-as-you-go price applies |

## Instance Price

### Billing formula
**Total fees = instance fees + backup capacity fees + traffic fees**
**Instance fees = shard price * number of shards= (node memory * memory price + node disk * disk price) * number of nodes* number of shards**
>The number of nodes is the sum of master and slave instances. For example, one master and one slave are 2 nodes, while one master and two slaves are 3 nodes.

## Billing Example


- For example, if you purchase 2 TDSQL instances (one-master-one-slave edition) in Beijing with 2 GB of shard memory and 500 GB of shard disk for 400 hours,
then the fees to be paid are calculated as follows:
 - Tier 1: (2 GB * 0.026194 USD/GB/hour + 500 GB * 0.000250 USD/GB/hour) * 2 nodes * 96 hours = 17.029248 USD
 - Tier 2: (2 GB * 0.013097 USD/GB/hour + 500 GB * 0.000250 USD/GB/hour) * 2 nodes * 264 hours = 48.830432 USD
 - Tier 3: (2 GB * 0.019646 USD/GB/hour + 500 GB * 0.000250 USD/GB/hour) * 2 nodes * 40 hours = 7.09552 USD
 - Total instance fees = tier 1 + tier 2 + tier 3 = 72.9552 USD
