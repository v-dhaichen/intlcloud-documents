3. Configure the table group in the pop-up dialog box.
 - **Select Cluster**: You can switch to the desired cluster.
 - **Table Group Name**: The name can contain up to 32 characters.
 - **Table Group ID**: If you select "Auto-generated", your table group will be assigned an ID starting from 1. If you select "Custom", you can specify any integer in the range of [1,50000] that has not been used under the cluster as the table group ID.
