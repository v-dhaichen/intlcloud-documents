### Overview
TencentDB for MongoDB allows users to create one or more read-only instances to separate read/write operations, which can help reduce the request amount sent to the master instance and improve the read loading capacity.

>Creating read-only instances is currently whitelisting. Please submit a ticket for the service.
>You can find the synchronization latency between the read-only instances and the master instance on the console.
>Due to the delay in data synchronization, read-only instances may not synchronize the data in real-time. If your business needs to separate read/write operations and real-time data synchronization, we recommend you read data from the slave nodes of the master instance. For more information, see [Connection Example](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/240/3563).


### Basic architecture
Changes on the master instance can be synced to read-only instances using oplog. Each read-only instance have at least 1 master and 2 slaves. The figure below describes the architecture:
