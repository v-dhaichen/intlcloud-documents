2. Select the linkage region, i.e., the region where the target instance resides.
>- Currently, MongoDB database migration is free of charge.
>- Please select the region with caution as it cannot be changed once the migration task is created.

### 1. Set the source and target databases
Enter relevant information to set the task, source database, and target database.

#### Set the task

- Scheduled Execution: Specify the start time of the migration task.
> - To modify the scheduled task, you must click **Scheduled Start** again after the check is passed, so as to make the task start at the specified time.
> - If the specified time has passed, the task will start immediately. You can also click **Start Now** to start the task immediately.

### 3. Check the task
