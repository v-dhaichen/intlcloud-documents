The following is TencentDB for MongoDB sharded instances billing formula. **Total price of an instance=Number of shards x Number of nodes in each shard x Price of one node**. 

Billing is pay-as-you-go, which is a postpay billing method. When you create a document database, we will freeze the hardware cost of one hour in your Tencent Cloud account and charge the usage fee on the dot of each hour (Beijing time). The billing time is accurate down to the second. With the pay-as-you-go billing method, you only need to pay for what you use, and no upfront payment is required.

Pay-as-you-go pricing includes 3 pricing tiers. The first tier is the initial purchase price. After a certain period of consistent usage, the price will drop to the third tier, which is almost half the price of the first tier. 

Prices for varying regions in USD are as follows.
