### 1.  **Service Content**
TencentDB for MongoDB is a professional high-performance distributed data storage service developed based on MongoDB, the world's most promising open source NoSQL database. It is 100% compatible with MongoDB protocol, and well suited for non-relational database use cases.

Additionally, TencentDB for MongoDB offers high-performance, reliable and user-friendly MongoDB cluster services. Each instance is either a replica set of at least one (1) master and two (2) slaves or a sharding cluster of multiple replica sets, ensuring high availability of user data.

### 2.  **Data Durability**
Tencent Cloud guarantees that the monthly durability of data storage with respect to the instances applied for by a user within the service period (i.e., the service period of MongoDB purchased by the user) is 99.9996%. That is, for each 1,000,000 instances applied for by a user each month, only 4 instances are exposed to data loss.

### 3.  **Data Deletion**
If a user voluntarily deletes the data or when the data needs to be deleted upon expiration of the service period for a user, Tencent Cloud will perform low level formatting of disks to completely and irrecoverably delete all data of the user prior to disposal or resale of the devices, and the disks will be demagnetized when they are discarded.
