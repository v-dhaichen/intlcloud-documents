An SQL statement query that takes more time than the specified value is referred to as a "slow query", and the corresponding statement is called a "slow query statement". The process where a database administrator (DBA) analyzes slow query statements and finds out the reasons why slow queries occur is known as "slow query analysis".

You can log in to the [TencentDB for MySQL Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb) and download slow logs from **Operational Logs** on the instance management page.
