TencentDB for MySQL allows you to assign instances to different projects for easier management. To do so, log in to the [TencentDB for MySQL Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb/), select the corresponding instance, and click **More** > **Assign to Project**.

- Read-only instances and disaster recovery instances are associated instances of the master instance and should be in the same project as the master instance.
- Assigning and moving database instances across projects will not affect the services provided by the instances.
- You need to specify a project to which a new instance belongs when purchasing it. The default project is **Default Project**.
- Assigned instances can be reassigned to other projects through the **Assign to Project** feature.
