If you are unable to access a TencentDB for MySQL instance over the private or public network, you can use the connectivity checker to easily troubleshoot connectivity issues.

### Private Network Connectivity Check
If you encounter a connectivity issue when accessing a TencentDB for MySQL instance from a CVM instance over the private network, you can use the connectivity check tool provided in the TencentDB for MySQL Console to easily troubleshoot the issue.
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MySQL Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb), select the instance to be troubleshot, and select the **Connectivity Check** tab on the instance management page.
2. When troubleshooting a private network connectivity issue, click **Add a CVM instance that accesses this instance** to add a CVM instance accessing this TencentDB for MySQL instance.
>Only CVM instances in the same region as the TencentDB for MySQL instance are listed by default. If you need cross-region access, enable network interconnection through a [peering connection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/553).

 - If the check status is **Normal**, it means that the CVM instance is allowed to access this TencentDB for MySQL instance over the private network.
 - If the check status is **Exceptional**, it means that the CVM instance cannot access the TencentDB for MySQL instance over the private network. In this case, see the **Suggestion** in the exceptional check item for solution.
