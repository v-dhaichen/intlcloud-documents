### Why can't I logically back up and download databases or tables in a sharding manner?
After the [backup](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/7513) feature was upgraded, both logical and physical backup files adopt the new compression algorithm, so some download-related features may be unavailable for the time being. In this case, you can perform logical backup of databases or tables in a sharding manner by selecting **Logical Backup** > **Specify Table** in the manual backup feature and download the completed backup file.

### Why does backup fail?
If the number of tables in a single instance exceeds one million, backup may fail, and database monitoring may be affected. Please control this value appropriately and make sure that it is below 1 million.

### How to reduce backup costs?
- Delete manual backups that are no longer used (you can do so in the console)
- Reduce the frequency of automatic data backup for non-core businesses (you can reduce the number of days for backup in a week, which should be at least 2 days) 
- Shorten the retention period of data and log backups for non-core businesses (a retention period of 7 days can meet the needs in most cases)

| Business Scenario | Recommended Backup Retention Period |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Core businesses | 7-732 days |
| Non-core, non-data businesses | 7 days |
| Archival businesses | 7 days. It is recommended to manually back up data based on your actual business needs and delete the backups promptly after use |
| Testing businesses | 7 days. It is recommended to manually back up data based on your actual business needs and delete the backups promptly after use |

### Can data and log backup be disabled in TencentDB for MySQL?
No.
- Data backups can be retained for 7-732 days. The option for reducing backup frequency will be available after backup becomes a paid service, so that you can reduce the capacity occupied by backup files.
- Log backups can be retained for 7-732 days and the retention period cannot be longer than that of data backups.
>Currently, backup capacity used is free of charge. If fees will be charged, we will inform you in advance. Please develop a backup schedule and plan the backup capacity appropriately to avoid potential extra fees in the future.

### Why cannot a downloaded backup file be decompressed/unpacked with tar?
>Given that backup files in the new version adopt a new compression algorithm, they cannot be unpacked/decompressed using the original tar tool; instead, xbstream and qpress are required.

1. The downloaded backup file should be unpacked with xbstream (a packing/unpacking tool offered by Percona) first.
```
xbstream -x < test_import_57_backup_20181114115236.xb 
```
Then, a .qb file can be obtained, such as test_import_57_backup_20181114115236.sql.qb.
2. The .qb file needs to be decompressed with qpress.
```
qpress -d test_import_57_backup_20181114115236.sql.qp
```
Then, the complete backup file can be obtained, such as test_import_57_backup_20181114115236.sql.

### How to download xbstream and qpress?
- xbstream is a subprogram of Percona XtraBackup. Before using it, you need to install Percona XtraBackup with `yum` or binary installation package.
- Download qpress [here](http://www.quicklz.com/) and extract the qpress binary files by running the tar command:
For more information on installation of xtrabackup and qpress, see [Restoring a Database from a Physical Backup File](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/31910).

### How to manually set up MySQL backup?
You can back up your MySQL data by offline migrating the data to the local file system. For more information, see [Migrating Data Offline](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/8464).


### How to back up data on my own?
TencentDB for MySQL instances are fully backed up on a daily basis. You can also proactively back up your data using the multi-threaded quick import/export tool provided by TencentDB or using mysqldump. For more information, see [Backup Methods](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/7513).

### How to view binlogs in MySQL?
- Download the binlogs from the console to the local file system such as a CVM instance.
- View them using mysqlbinlog. To do so, mysqlbinlog v3.4 or higher is required in MySQL v5.6.

### How to achieve sync of real-time data in two TencentDB for MySQL instances in a local dual-backup architecture?
For this purpose, you can purchase [disaster recovery instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/7272) in the TencentDB for MySQL Console.
