## Upgrading an Instance
An upgrade refers to the process in which an existing TencentDB instance is upgraded to higher specifications. During upgrade, the service will be interrupted for just a few seconds, so you are recommended to upgrade your instance during off-hours. Once an upgrade starts, it cannot be interrupted. Currently, the degrade operation is not supported in the console. If you need to degrade an instance, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).

1. Log in to the [TencentDB for PostgreSQL Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/pgsql), select the desired instance in the instance list, and click **Upgrade** in the "Operation" column.
2. In the pop-up window, select the desired specification and make the payment. Once the payment is completed, the system will automatically upgrade the instance specification.
3. After successful upgrade, the instance will be billed based on the new specification automatically.
