## Billing Example
Assume that you purchase a pay-as-you-go TencentDB for PostgreSQL instance with a memory size of 8 GB and disk capacity of 500 GB in the Guangzhou region and use it for 24 hours.
The fees for the current month are calculated as follows:
Instance price = memory specification fees + storage capacity fees = 0.0005 USD/GB/hour * 500 GB * 24 hours + 0.052 USD/GB/hour * 8 GB * 24 hours = 15.984 USD
