## Overview
Download [redis-port (Linux 64-bit)](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/47154504189a8941250f57b60f1e2fcb/redis-port.tgz)

redis-port is a collection of open-source tools mainly used for database sync, data import, and data export between Redis nodes and supports cross-version Redis data migration. The toolkit contains the following tools:
- redis-sync: It is used for data migration between Redis instances.
- redis-restore: It supports importing Redis backup files (in RDB format) to the specified Redis instance.
- redis-dump: It supports backing up Redis data in RDB format.
- redis-decode: It supports decoding the Redis RDB backup files into readable files.

## Compatible Versions
- Source instances on Redis 2.8, 3.0, 3.2, and 4.0 are supported.
- Target instances on Redis 2.8, 3.0, 3.2, and 4.0 and in all editions of TencentDB are supported, including Redis Standard Edition (Community), Cluster Edition (Community), Standard Edition (CKV), and Cluster Edition (CKV).


## Online Migration via redis-sync
**How it works**
- redis-sync has two modules which are simulated as replication nodes to sync data from the source instance and translate the replicated data into write commands to update the target instance.
- Data replication is done in two phases: full sync and incremental sync.

**Parameter descriptions:**
- -n: Number of concurrent write tasks, which is recommended to be either left alone or set to CPU core quantity * 2.
- -m: Source instance address in the format of `"password"@ip:port` or `ip:port` (in password-free mode).
- -t: Target instance address in the format of `"password"@ip:port` or `ip:port` (in password-free mode).
- --tmpfile=FILE: Temporary filename.
- --tmpfile-size=SIZW: Maximum length of the temporary file.
- --help: Help command.

**Sample:**
```
./redis-sync -m 127.0.0.1:6379 -t "xxx2018"@10.0.5.8:6379
```

**Output log**:

```
[root@VM_5_16_centos bin]# ./redis-sync -m 127.0.0.1:6379 -t "xxx2018"@10.0.5.8:6379
2019/02/21 09:56:00 sync.go:76: [INFO] sync: master = "127.0.0.1:6379", target = "xxx2018@10.0.5.8:6379"

```

**Use instructions**:
- The database capacity of the target instance should be greater than that of the source instance; otherwise, the migration will fail.
- If migration is interrupted for reasons such as network failure, among others, you need to empty the target instance first and then perform migration again; otherwise, there may be dirty data.
- The progress of migration is displayed in the log, where "sync: rdb = 9063349 - [100.00%]" indicates that full data has been synced and incremental data sync is in progress, while "speed=(0/0,0/0,0)" indicates that incremental data has been synced.
- You can stop data sync and migration by pressing Ctrl + C or through other means.

## Importing Data via redis-restore
redis-restore supports importing Redis backup files (in RDB format) on Redis 2.8, 3.0, 3.2, and 4.0 as well as AOF files into the specified Redis instance.

**Parameter descriptions:**
- -n: Number of concurrent Write tasks, which is recommended to be either left alone or set to CPU core quantity * 2.
- -i: RDB file path.
- -t: Target instance address in the format of `"password"@ip:port` or `ip:port` (in password-free mode).
- -a: AOF file path.
- --db=DB: ID of the imported DB, which is the same as the source instance ID by default.
- --unixtime-in-milliseconds=EXPR: The Key expiration time value is updated in the process of data import.
- --help: Help command.

**Sample:**
```
./redis-restore dump.rdb -t 127.0.0.1:6379
```


## Backing up Data via redis-dump
redis-dump supports backing up Redis data into RDB files and incremental data into AOF files.
>TencentDB for Redis currently does not support backing up data via redis-dump. You can back up and download data in the TencentDB for Redis Console or through APIs. However, you can use redis-dump to back up your self-built Redis instances.

**Parameter descriptions:**
- -n: Number of concurrent Write tasks, which is recommended to be either left alone or set to CPU core quantity * 2.
- -m: Redis instance address in the format of `"password"@ip:port` or `ip:port` (in password-free mode).
- -o: Path to the outputted RDB file.
- -a: Path to the outputted AOF file.
- --help: Help command.

**Sample:**
```
./redis-dump  127.0.0.1:6379 -o dump.rdb
```
