## Scenario
TencentDB for SQL Server supports migrating data from an SQL Server database created by an CVM instance to a TencentDB for SQL Server instance. This document describes how to configure and run a migration task.

>- Before migration, make sure that the destination instance SQL Server edition is not simpler than that of the source instance.
>- For the bak files used for migration, please make sure that each bak file contains only one database.
>- The name of the migrated database cannot be the same as that of the TencentDB for SQL Server instance.**

## Directions
### Creating a Migration Task
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for SQL Server Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver) and select **Data Transmission** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create Task**, enter the task name, source database information, and destination database information, and select **SQL Server instance created by CVM** as the source instance type.

3. After clicking **Next**, you need to configure the source SQL Server instance first and then configure the migration task.
 If the error message "Source instance info checking failed!" is prompted, please check the following items for troubleshooting:
>- Whether the sa account of the source SQL Server instance exists.
>- Whether the sa account password of the source SQL Server instance is correct.
>- Whether the IP and port of the source SQL Server instance work properly.

### Configuring the Source SQL Server Instance
1. Enable the sa account for the source SQL Server instance.
2. Select **Allow remote connections to this server** in **Connections** and set a reasonable remote query timeout.

6. Allow SQL Server port communication and open port 445 (for a basic network) or 49001 (for a private network) in Windows Firewall.
7. (Optional) If **VPC** is selected as the **CVM network**, you need to configure the freeSSHd tool.
 1. Download and install [freeSSHd](http://www.freesshd.com/freeSSHd.exe) with the default options, and agree to start the freeSSHd service.
 2. Double-click the freeSSHd icon on the desktop. Then, right-click the freeSSHd icon in the taskbar to open the Settings page for configuration.
 3. Select the **SSH** tab and set the port to 49001 (the default port here is 22, which should be changed to 49001). ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/46b896f77b9e533e5a6c7fa2783bef1d.png)
 4. Select the **Server status** tab and start the SSH server.
 5. Select the **Authentication** tab and select **Allowed** for password authentication.
 6. Select the **Users** tab and enter the user tencent_vpc_migrate (this username cannot be changed) and the password tencent_vpc_migrate (this password cannot be changed) as shown below:

 7. Use D:\dbbackup\ (**this path cannot be changed**) as the backup folder used during SQL Server migration. Select the **SFTP** tab and configure this path as the "SFTP home path".

### Configuring the Migration Task
Select the migration type, set the database (by selecting the database tables to be migrated), and click **Save and Verify**. If the verification fails, you can troubleshoot as prompted.

### Starting the Migration Task
After the task is created, return to the task list. At this time, the task status is **initializing**. Select the task and click **Start** to sync the task.

### Completing the Migration Task
After the data synchronization is completed (i.e., the progress bar shows 100%), you need to click **Finish** to end the synchronization process. If you selected **Incremental Synchronization** when configuring the migration task, you need to click **Finish** when the progress bar shows 99%. You can check whether the migration is successful based on the **status**.
 - If the task status is **task succeeded*, the data migration is successful.
 - If the status is **task failed*, the migration failed. Please check the failure information, fix it accordingly, and then re-migrate.
