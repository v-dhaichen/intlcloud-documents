## Policy Syntax
CAM policy:

```
{	 
        "version":"2.0", 
        "statement": 
        [ 
           { 
              "effect":"effect", 
              "action":["action"], 
              "resource":["resource"], 
               "condition": {"key":{"value"}} 
           } 
       ] 
} 
```

- **version** is required. Currently, only "2.0" is allowed.
- **statement** describes the details of one or more permissions. This element contains a permission or permission set of other elements such as effect, action, resource, and condition. One policy has only one statement.
- **effect** describes whether the result produced by the statement is "allowed" (allow) or "denied" (deny). This element is required.
- **action** describes the allowed or denied action (operation). An operation can be an API (prefixed with "sqlserver:"). This element is required.
- **resource** describes the details of authorization. A resource is described in a six-segment format. Detailed resource definitions vary by product. This element is required.
- **condition** describes the condition for the policy to take effect. A condition consists of operator, action key, and action value. A condition value may contain information such as time and IP address. Some services allow you to specify additional values in a condition. This element is required.

## Operations in TencentDB for SQL Server
In a TencentDB for SQL Server policy statement, you can specify any API operation from any service that supports TencentDB for SQL Server. APIs prefixed with `sqlserver:` should be used for TencentDB for SQL Server, such as `sqlserver:DescribeDBInstances` or `sqlserver:CreateAccount`.

To specify multiple operations in a single statement, separate them with commas, as shown below:
```
"action":["sqlserver:action1","sqlserver:action2"]
```

You can also specify multiple operations using a wildcard. For example, you can specify all operations beginning with "Describe" in name, as shown below:
```
"action":["sqlserver:Describe*"]
```

If you want to specify all operations in TencentDB for SQL Server, use a wildcard as shown below:
```
"action"ï¼š["sqlserver:*"]
```

## TencentDB for SQL Server Resources
Each CAM policy statement has its own resources.
Resources are generally in the following format:
```
qcs:project_id:service_type:region:account:resource
```

- **project_id** describes the project information, which is only used to enable compatibility with legacy CAM logic and can be left empty.
- **service_type** describes the product abbreviation such as sqlserver.
- **region** describes the region information, such as ap-guangzhou.
- **account** is the root account of the resource owner, such as uin/653339763.
- **resource** describes detailed resource information of each product, such as instance/instance_id1 or instance/*.

For example, you can specify a resource for a specific instance (mssql-m8oh024t) in a statement as shown below:
```
"resource":[ "qcs::sqlserver:ap-guangzhou:uin/653339763:instance/mssql-m8oh024t"]
```

You can also use the wildcard "*" to specify it for all instances that belong to a specific account as shown below:
```
"resource":[ "qcs::sqlserver:ap-guangzhou:uin/653339763:instance/*"]
```

If you want to specify all resources or a specific API operation does not support resource-level permission control, you can use the wildcard "*" in the "resource" element as shown below:
```
"resource": ["*"]
```

To specify multiple resources in a single command, separate them with commas. Below is an example where two resources are specified:
```
"resource":["resource1","resource2"]
```

The table below describes the resources that can be used by TencentDB for SQL Server and the corresponding resource description methods, where words prefixed with $ are placeholders, `project` refers to a project ID, `region` refers to a region, and `account` refers to an account ID.

| Resource | Resource Description Method in Authorization Policy |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Instance   | ```qcs::sqlserver:$region:$account:instance/$instanceId``` |
| VPC    | ```qcs::vpc:$region:$account:vpc/$vpcId```                   |
| Security group | ```qcs::cvm:$region:$account:sg/$sgId```                     |
