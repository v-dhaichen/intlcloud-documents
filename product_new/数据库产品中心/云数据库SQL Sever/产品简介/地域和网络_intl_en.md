## Network
### Network Restrictions
- Tencent Cloud services in the same region can communicate with each other via private network.
- If a CVM instance on a private network need to access TencentDB for SQL Server on a basic network in a different AZ in the same region, you need to manually configure the subnet and assign a private network IP to enable communication.
- Tencent Cloud services in different regions cannot communicate with one another through a private basic network. Their communication through a private network requires Peering Connection.
- Currently, public IP is not supported by TencentDB for SQL Server. If you need to use a public IP, you can use the port mapping function of SSH2 to connect, configure, and manage an instance from the internet. 
- When purchasing TencentDB for SQL Server, we recommend selecting the same region as your CVM instance to reduce the access delay.

### Network Connectivity Test
The network connectivity test tool provided on the [TencentDB for SQL Server purchase page](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver#/) can be used to check if there are CVM instances that can communicate with TencentDB for SQL Server over a private network for the selected regions/AZ and network types.
