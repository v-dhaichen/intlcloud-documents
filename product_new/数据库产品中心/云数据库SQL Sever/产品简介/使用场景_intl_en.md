With Direct Connect, VPN and database synchronization tools, companies can sync data from self-built data centers or other cloud vendors to TencentDB for SQL Server in real time. Even if the data in the self-built data centers is completely lost, data will still be securely stored in TencentDB.

## Mobile Office
TencentDB for SQL Sever supports quick deployment of your mobile office platforms such as OA, ERP and sales management, where the data is stored in Tencent Cloud's secure subnets and the database is protected by multiple measures for improved reliability.

## Data Warehouse and Data Analytics Platform
TencentDB for SQL Sever helps you create a cloud-based data warehouse and data analytics platform with SQL Server's built-in business intelligence, IT dashboards and collaboration with SharePoint.

## Business Elasticity
Business promotion and major events result in high peaks, and self-built data centers are usually not optimized for cost considerations. In contrast, Cloud is scalable and an elastic IDC can be built in the cloud data center to be scaled at any time. With CVM and TencentDB for SQL Server, elastic business needs can be met.
