### How is TencentDB for SQL Server priced?
TencentDB for SQL Server includes a Microsoft license. It is pay-as-you-go. 
The price consists of two parts: instance specification (memory capacity) and storage capacity (disk capacity). For pricing details for different regions, see [Product Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/8294).

### How do I purchase a TencentDB for SQL Server instance?
Log in to the [TencentDB for SQL Server Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver) to create an instance or purchase an instance directly on the [purchase page](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver).


### Do I have to buy an SQL Server license?
Tencent Cloud can provide TencentDB instances with "license included". The price of a "license included" model includes a SQL Server software license, underlying hardware resources and TencentDB management functions, so you don't need to purchase a Microsoft SQL Server license separately.
With a "license included" database, you only need to pay for instance specifications and usage duration, and donâ€™t have to worry about hardware and licensing costs. So you only pay low variable costs instead of high fixed costs, which helps you reduce IT costs.

>- Purchasing TencentDB for SQL Server does not mean that you purchased a Microsoft SQL Server long-term license contract; therefore, you should not use the TencentDB license outside of this service. For more information, see [Microsoft Volume Licensing Product Terms and Online Services Terms](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/ProductResults.aspx?doc=Product%20Terms,OST&fid=20).
>- The basic price of TencentDB for SQL Server **does not include** other Microsoft or Tencent Cloud services.
