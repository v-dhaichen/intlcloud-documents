### What is SQL Server?
SQL Server is a relational database from Microsoft. It has high scalability and performance as well as the ability to query, search, synchronize, report, and analyze data. There are multiple editions of SQL Server, and each edition has its unique features.
Database supports SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3, 2012 SP3, and 2016 SP1, which enables custom applications developed by Microsoft .NET and Visual Studio. With many new features and key improvements in the use of data in service-oriented architecture (SOA) and business processes based on Microsoft BizTalk Server, 2016 SP1 has become the most powerful and inclusive SQL Server version. You can easily set up, operate, and scale up SQL Server deployment on the cloud to cope with fast business changes.

### What is the architecture of TencentDB for SQL Server like?
TencentDB for SQL Server consists of a master database and a mirror database that are deployed in different racks. Each database corresponds to a group of monitoring agents which monitor the database in real time based on the heartbeat. The cluster management scheduling center consists of two sets of independently deployed decision-making clusters and configuration clusters and is mainly used to manage the normal operations of the database node group, access gateway cluster and HDFS. The Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) makes available data disaster recovery service with cold backup. The gateway cluster is accessed to provide a unique IP, and if the data node is switched, the IP won't change.
