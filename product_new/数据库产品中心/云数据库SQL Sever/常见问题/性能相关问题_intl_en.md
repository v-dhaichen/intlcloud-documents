### Where can TencentDB for SQL Server be used?
- **Cloud-based business system**
When you build a business system directly in the cloud, TencentDB for SQL Server can be used as the basic database, which not only provides a stable and high-performance database support solution, but also effectively improves the performance of the business system.
- **Remote (in-cloud) data disaster recovery**
Electronic data is the core asset of every company. Data loss by force majeure and man-made mistakes can have serious consequences. However, remote disaster recovery from self-building remote IDC is not cost-effective. Using TencentDB as a remote database for disaster recovery is a good solution.
With Direct Connect, VPN and database synchronization tools, companies can sync data from self-built data centers or other cloud vendors to TencentDB for SQL Server in real time. Even if the data in the self-built data centers is completely lost, data will still be securely stored in TencentDB.
- **Mobile office**
TencentDB for SQL Sever supports quick deployment of your mobile office platforms such as OA, ERP and sales management. Data is stored in Tencent Cloud's secure subnets and the database is protected by multiple measures for security and reliability.
- **Data warehouse and data analytics platform**
TencentDB for SQL Sever helps you create a cloud-based data warehouse and data analytics platform with SQL Server's built-in business intelligence, IT dashboards and collaboration with SharePoint.
- **Business Elasticity**
Business promotion and major events result in high peaks, and self-built data centers are usually not optimized for cost considerations. In contrast, Cloud is scalable and an elastic IDC can be built in the cloud data center to be scaled at any time. With CVM and TencentDB for SQL Server, elastic business needs can be met.
