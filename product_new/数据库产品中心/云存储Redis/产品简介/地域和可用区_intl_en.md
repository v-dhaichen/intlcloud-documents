TencentDB for Redis is available in various regions in and outside Mainland China. It can be deployed wherever CVM are deployed.

## Network Descriptions
- Tencent Cloud services in the same region can communicate with one another over private networks.
- A CVM instance in a VPC can communicate with a TencentDB for Redis instance on a basic network in a different availability zone in the same region, only after a subnet is configured and a VPC IP is assigned.
- Tencent Cloud services in different regions cannot communicate with one another over the private network. They can communicate over a VPC only after a peering connection is configured.
 > It is recommended to select the same region for the TencentDB for Redis instance as for the CVM instance so as to reduce access latency.
