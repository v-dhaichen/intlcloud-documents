  - **Region**: (required) a target region to which a snapshot is copied
    Please check the snapshot quota and geographical restriction when you select the region.
4. Click **OK** to start the replication. Hover over the information icon to view the status of the source snapshot. The new snapshot is added to the target region.  
5. Once the replication is completed, you can view the new snapshot in the snapshot list of the target region.
> The source snapshot cannot be deleted during the cross-region replication of this snapshot.

 During the process of cross-region replication:
 - Status of source snapshot: you can view it by going to the source region’s **snapshot list** and looking in the status column on the source snapshot’s row.
 - Status of target snapshot: you can view it by going to the snapshot list page of the target region.
