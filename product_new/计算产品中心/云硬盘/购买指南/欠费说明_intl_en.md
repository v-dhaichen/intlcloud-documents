### Pay-as-you-go cloud disks

- When you no longer use pay-as-you-go resources, **terminate them as soon as possible** to avoid further fee deduction.
- Since your actual resource consumption changes from time to time, deviation may exist for the stated balance.

### Balance Alert
The system estimates the number of days it takes your account balance to become negative based on the past 24 hours usage and current balance. If itâ€™s less than 5 days, the system will send a balance alert to your Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators via the Message Center, email, and SMS.

### Arrears Alert
For pay-as-you-go resources, fees are deducted on the hour. When your account balance becomes negative (Point 1 in the figure above), we will notify the Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators via email, text message, and the Message Center.

### Arrears Processing

- You can continue to use your Pay-as-You-Go cloud disk for 2 hours from the moment your account becomes negative. We will also continue to bill you for this period. When your account is in arrears for 2 hours (Point 2 in the figure above), your cloud disk will automatically shut down. The cloud disk will be unavailable and can only store data. We will also stop billing you for service. 
- If your Tencent Cloud account is topped up to a positive balance within 24 hours after automatic shutdown, the cloud disk will be restored and billing continues.
- If your account remains negative for 26 hours after shutdown, (total time inclusive of 2 hours normal usage and 24 hours service suspension, Point 3 in the figure above), the Pay-as-You-Go disk will be repossessed, and all data will be deleted and **cannot be recovered**. We will notify the Tencent Cloud account creator and all the collaborators via email, SMS and the Message Center when the cloud disk is repossessed.
