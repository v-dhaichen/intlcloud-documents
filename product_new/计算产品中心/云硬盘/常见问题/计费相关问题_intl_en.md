- You can continue to use your Pay-as-You-Go cloud disk for 2 hours from the moment your account becomes negative. We will also continue to bill you for this period. When your account is in arrears for 2 hours, the service will automatically shut down. You cloud disk will not be available and can only store data. We will also stop billing you for service.
- If your Tencent Cloud account is topped up to a positive balance  within 24 hours after automatic shutdown, the cloud disk will be restored and billing continues.
- If the balance is less than 0 for 24 hours after the cloud disk has services suspended, the system will repossess the pay-as-you-go disk and notify the Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators via email, text message, and the Message Center. After repossession, all data will be erased and **cannot be retrieved**.
