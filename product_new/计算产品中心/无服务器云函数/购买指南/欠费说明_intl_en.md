## Billing Cycle

SCF is billed by usage on an hourly basis. The fee of previous hour is calculated on the next hour, and deducted from your account balance. A bill is generated at the same time for your future reference.

## Rules for Suspense of Service

SCF is still available within 24 hours after the arrears. 24 hours after the arrears,

* You are unable to create new functions and manage existing functions.
* Existing functions can not be triggered.

When you top up your account balance to a positive value, SCF is automatically recovered.
