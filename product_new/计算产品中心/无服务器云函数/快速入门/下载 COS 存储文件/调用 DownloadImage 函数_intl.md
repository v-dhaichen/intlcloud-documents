There are two ways to call the DownloadImage function. You can select one and test it based on your actual needs:
- [Manual simulation test](#ManualSimulationTest)
- [File upload test using COS](#UploadFileTestUsingCOS)

### Manual Simulation Test

1. On the details page of the created DownloadImage function, select the **Function code** tab.
2. Click **Change** to pop up the "Change test template" window.
3. In the "Change test template" window that pops up, select "COS file upload/deletion event template", and click **Submit**.
4. Click **Test** to execute the code and return the test result. See the figure below:

 - Return result: This shows the result of function execution returned by the **return** statement in the code.
 - Summary: This shows the information of function execution such as duration and memory.
 - Log: This shows the log generated by the function runtime, including the print statement in the user code, the trace stack of the function execution failure, and so on.
   
 >? As shown in the figure above, when the test template simulates the "COS file upload" message, you need to replace the bucket name, appid and other information under the "COS" object in the template with real data; otherwise, a "NoSuchBucket" exception will be thrown when the file is downloaded, causing the execution result to return "Fail". Therefore, **it is recommended that you directly use [File upload test using COS](#UploadFileTestUsingCOS).** 
5. Click **Configure** to pop up the "Configure test template" window.
6. In the "Configure test template" window that pops up, select "Create a template", enter the following information, and click **Submit**. See the figure below:

 - Test event template: Name it "test-scf".
 - Reference template code: Select "COS file upload/deletion event template" and modify the parameters of the **cosBucket** and **cosObject** structures in the "Reference template code".
    - Replace the "name" in "cosBucket" with "test-scf".
    - Replace the "appid" in "cosBucket" with "the appid of your account".
    - Replace the "region" in "cosBucket" with "guangzhou".
    - Replace the "key" in "cosObject" with the real key data.
    >! The filename in the "key" parameter needs to be replaced with the actual filename in the "test-scf" bucket.
2. Click **Test** to execute the code and return the test result. See the figure below:
