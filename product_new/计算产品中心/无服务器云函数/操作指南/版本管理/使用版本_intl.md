The version feature is mainly used to fix the function configuration and code and avoid the impact of development, debugging and testing on the business. After [releasing a function version](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/15371), you can use the version by calling the function of the specified version.
>The $LATEST version is used for code development and testing.

### Version Triggers

Currently, all released versions of functions can be independently bound to triggers. For the same function, different versions are independent of one another, and each trigger can independently trigger the function.
For the number of triggers, the following restrictions apply:
- Up to 2 triggers can be configured on the function trigger page.
For example, if you have created a demo1 function on the function trigger page and bound two COS triggers to version 1 of the function, then you cannot add COS triggers for other versions of the function. Only new timer or CMQ topic triggers can be added.
- Function triggers configured in other products or services are not subject to this restriction.
For example, any number of API Gateway triggers can be configured to trigger the same function.

>To increase the maximum number for triggers (i.e. quota limit), you can apply by [submitting a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).

### TencentCloud API-triggered Versions

When the InvokeFunction API of TencentCloud API is used to trigger a function call, the specific version to be triggered can be specified with the optional parameter Qualifier. Without this parameter, the $LATEST version will be triggered by default.
