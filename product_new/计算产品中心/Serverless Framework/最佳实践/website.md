### 1. Install

```console
$ npm install -g serverless
```

### 2. Create

```console
$ mkdir my-website
$ cd my-website
```

Use the following command to create `serverless.yml` and `.env` files

```console
$ touch serverless.yml
$ touch .env # your Tencent API Keys
```
Add the access keys of a [Tencent CAM Role](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi) with `AdministratorAccess` in the `.env` file, using this format: 

```
# .env
TENCENT_SECRET_ID=XXX
TENCENT_SECRET_KEY=XXX
```
**Note:** If you don't have a Tencent Cloud account, you could [sign up](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/register) first.

Move/Create your code in the folder, and the directory should look something like this:

```
|- code
  |- index.html
|- serverless.yml
|- .env      # your Tencent SecretId/Key/AppId

```


* If you don't have a Tencent Cloud account, you could [sign up](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/register) first. 

The `code` directory could either be a simple directory of html/css/js assets files, or a full fledged React app.
