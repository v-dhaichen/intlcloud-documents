## Overview
Port 53 is Domain Name Server’s (DNS) open port. It is primarily used for domain name resolution. The DNS acts as a translator between the domain name and IP address, so users only need to remember the domain name to quickly access the website.

The “Classified Catalogue of Telecommunications Businesses” (2015 Edition) has categorized recursive Internet domain name resolution services as telecommunications services (Code number: B26-1). To manage recursive domain name services, the telecommunications services permit must be obtained.
