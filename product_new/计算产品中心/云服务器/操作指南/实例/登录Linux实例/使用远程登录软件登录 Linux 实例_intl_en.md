## Scenario

This document takes PuTTY software as an example to introduce how to log in to a Linux instance by using remote login software on a local computer with a Windows system.


## Applicable Local OS

Windows

## Authentication Method

**Password** or **Key**

## Prerequisites
- You must already have the admin account and password (or key) for the instance to be logged in to.
 - If you use a system default password to log in to the instance, first go to [Internal Message](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message) to get it.
 - If you forget your password, then [reset the instance password](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16566).
- A public IP has been purchased and obtained for your CVM instance, and port 22 is open (this is open by default for CVMs purchased with quick configuration).


## Steps
