## Scenario


VNC login is a browser-based method of CVM remote connection that Tencent Cloud offers its users. When a client does not have remote login installed or cannot use it and in the situation where login cannot be accomplished by any other means, the user can connect to a CVM using VNC login and observe the CVM’s status and can also do basic CVM management operations using the CVM account.    

## Applicable OS

Windows, Linux, or macOS.

## Use Limits

- The features of copy/paste, Chinese input, and file upload/download are currently not supported on CVMs using VNC login. 
- Main scream browsers must be used when using VNC login of a CVM, such as Chrome, Firefox, and IE 10 or above.
- A VNC login is a dedicated terminal, meaning that only one user at a time can use a VNC login.

##  Prerequisites
You must already have the admin account/password (or key) for the Linux instance to be logged in to.
- If you use a system default password to log in to the instance, then go to [internal message](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message) to get it.
If you forgot the password, then [reset instance password](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16566).

## Steps

1. Log in to the [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index).
2. On the instance’s management page, select the Linux CVM that you want to log in to and click **Log In**, as shown below:
