## Resetting Password

> You can only reset the password of a CVM when it is shut down. If you reset the password while a CVM is running, a forced shutdown may result in data loss or file system corruption.

1. Log in to the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm).
2. Shut down the CVM whose password you want to reset.
3. Open the password resetting box.
  - If you want to reset the password of a single shut-down instance, click **More** > **Password/Key** > **Reset Password** in the Operation column on the right.
  - If you want to reset the passwords of multiple instances all at once, select all the CVMs whose passwords you want to reset, and click **Reset Password** at the top of the list to modify their login passwords all at the same time. If the passwords of some instances cannot be reset, the reasons will be displayed.
4. Enter a new password in the Reset Password pop-up box, confirm the password, and click “Next”.
5. After the password is reset successfully, you will receive a confirmation message via [Internal Message](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message), and then you can use the new password to log in to the CVM.
