## Region

### Overview

A region is the physical location of the IDC. In Tencent Cloud, different regions are fully isolated, ensuring the maximal stability and fault tolerance among those regions. To reduce access latency and increase download speeds, we recommend you select the region nearest to your customers.

You can view the following table or use the [DescribeRegions](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/9456) API to view the complete list of regions.

### Related Features

- The networks of different regions are fully isolated from each other, and Tencent Cloud products of different regions **cannot communicate via private network by default**.
- Tencent Cloud products of different regions can access the Internet through [Public IP](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5224). Tencent Cloud products in VPCs can also communicate with each other by using [Peering Connection](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/5000) provided by Tencent Cloud through Tencent Cloudâ€™s high-speed connected network, to implement connectivity that is more stable and faster than Internet access.
- [Cloud Load Balancer](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214) currently supports intra-region traffic forwarding, and binding of CVMs in the same region. If the [cross-region binding](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/12014) function is enabled, then binding CVMs to the Cloud Load Balancer across regions is supported.

## Availability Zone

### Overview

Availability zones refer to Tencent Cloud physical IDCs in the same region with independent power and network resources. They are designed to ensure that the failures within an availability zone can be isolated (except for large-scale disaster or major power failure) without spreading to and affecting other zones, so as to ensure users' business stability. By starting an instance in an independent availability zone, users can protect their applications from being affected by failures that occur in a single location.
You can view the following table or use the [DescribeZones](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/9455) API to view the complete list of availability zones.

### Related Features

Tencent Cloud products that are in the same region and different availability zones, but in the same VPC, are interconnected through private network. they can be accessed directly through the [private IP](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5225).
>Private network interconnection refers to the interconnection of resources under the same account. Private networks for resources under different accounts are completely isolated.

## How to Select the Region and Availability Zone

When selecting the region and availability zone, you must take the following factors into consideration:
- The region where the CVM is located, your location, and the location of your users.
We recommend that when you purchase CVMs, you choose the region that is closest to your users to minimize the access latency and improve access speed.
- The relationship between CVMs and other Tencent Cloud products.
We recommend that when you select other Tencent Cloud products, you try to make them all in the same region and availability zone to allow them communicate with each other through the private network, reducing access latency and increasing access speeds.
- Considerations for high reliability and disaster recovery of businesses.
Even in a scenario where there is only one VPC, we still recommend that you deploy businesses in different availability zones to guarantee failure isolation between availability zones and to implement cross-AZ disaster recovery.
- There may be a network communication delay between different availability zones, so you need to make an assessment based on the actual requirements of the businesses to find the optimal balance point between high availability and low delay.
- If you need to access CVMs in other countries or regions, we recommend you select a CVM in other countries or regions for access. If you create a CVM in [Mainland China](#MainlandChina) and access [servers in other countries and regions](#InternationalArea) there will be relatively high access delay. We do not recommend you do this.

### Migrating an Instance to Another Availability Zone

For a launched instance, its availability zone cannot be changed. But you can migrate it to another availability zone through other means. The migration process involves creating a custom image using the original instance, using the custom image to launch an instance in a new availability zone and updating the configuration of the new instance.
1. Create a custom image for the current instance. For more information, see [Creating a Custom Image](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4942).
2. If the network environment of the current instance is [VPC](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5227) and the private IP address needs to be retained after the migration, you can first delete the subnet in the current availability zone and then create a subnet in the new availability zone with the same IP address range as that of the original subnet. Please note that a subnet can be deleted only when it contains no available instances. Thus, all the instances in the current subnet should be migrated to the new subnet.
3. Create a new instance in the new availability zone by using the custom image you have just created. You can choose the same type and configuration as those of the original instance, or choose new ones. For more information, see [Purchasing and Launching Instances](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4855).
4. If an Elastic IP is associated with the original instance, dissociate it from the old instance and associate it with the new instance. For more information, see [Elastic IP](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5733).
5. (Optional) If the original instance is billed on a [Pay-as-you-go](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2180) basis, then you can choose to terminate the original instance. For more information, see [Terminating Instances](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4930).

### Copying Images to Other Regions

Actions such as launching and viewing instances have region attributes. If the image of the instance that you need to launch does not exist in the region, the image needs to be copied to the current region. For more information, see [Copying Images](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4943).
