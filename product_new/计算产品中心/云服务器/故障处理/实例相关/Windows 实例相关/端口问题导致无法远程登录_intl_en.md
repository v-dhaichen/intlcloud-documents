This document introduces how to troubleshoot the issue of inability to remotely log in to a CVM due to port problems.
> The following operations take a CVM with the Windows Server 2012 system as an example.
>

## Diagnostic Tool
You can use the following tool to check whether the inability to log in is related to port or security group configuration:
- [Port Verification](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/helper) 

If it is detected to be a security group configuration problem, you can use the **Open All Ports** in the [Port Verification](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/helper) to open the related ports to the Internet and then try to log in again. If you still cannot log in after opening the ports to the Internet, please refer to the following content to troubleshoot the issue.

## Troubleshooting Approaches

### Checking Network Connectivity

You can use the local Ping command to test the network connectivity. At the same time, you can test on computers in different environments (different IP ranges or different carriers), to check whether it is a local network problem or a server problem.

1. Open the command line tool on your local computer.
 - Windows systems: Click **Start** > **Run**, enter **cmd**, and the command line dialog box will pop up.
 - Mac OS systems: Open the **Terminal** tool.
2. Execute the following command to test the network connection.
```
ping + CVM Instance public IP address
```
For example, execute the `ping 193.112.XXX.XXX` command.
 - If the network is normal, the following result is returned. In this case, please [check the remote desktop service configuration](#F2).

 - If the network has an exception, the **Request Timeout** prompt will appear. In this case, please refer to [Ping Does Not Connect to Instance IP Address](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/14639).
3. Execute the following command and press **Enter** to check whether the remote port is open and accessible.
```
telnet + CVM instance public IP address + Port number
```
For example, execute the `telnet 139.199.XXX.XXX 3389` command. This is shown in the following figure:
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/e18be3704977545d5c952d3a583f2ccc/image.png)
 - Normal: Black screen, only the cursor appears. This indicates that the port (3389) can be accessed. Please [check whether the instance remote desktop service is enabled](#F2).
 - Exceptional: The connection fails, as shown in the following figure. This indicates that there is a network problem. See the corresponding part of the network.

### Checking Remote Desktop Service Configuration

#### Logging in to the CVM using the VNC

> The VNC method is the recommended login method when you are unable to log in to the CVM using the standard method.
>
1. Log in to the [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm).
2. Select the CVM to check and click **Log in**. This is shown in the following figure:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/d9ccf04da21f4ac86d624742c87d5628.png)
3. In the **Log into Windows Instance** window that pops up, select **Other login methods (VNC)**, and click **Log in** to log in to the CVM.
4. In the login window that pops up, select **Send Remote Command** in the top left corner, and click **Ctrl-Alt-Delete** to enter the system login interface as shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/5064251ea86085326e86884a1c13ef6b.png)

#### Checking whether the remote desktop configuration of the CVM Is Enabled

1. In the CVM, right click **This Computer** > **Properties** to open the **System** window.
2. In the **System** window, select **Advanced System Configurations** to open the **System Properties** window.
3. In the **System Properties** window, select the **Remote** tab page. Check whether **Allow remote connections to this computer** in the **Remote Desktop** function column is checked off. This is shown in the following figure.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/2ee4d1abf5ebf351ed814d6644bc7d58.png)
 - If it is, this indicates that the remote connection configuration is enabled. Please [check whether remote access ports are enabled](#F3).
 - If it is not, check **Allow remote connections to this computer**, and try to remotely connect to the instance again to check whether the connection is successful.

### Checking Whether Remote Access Ports Are Open

1. In the CVM, click <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/f0c84862ef30956c201c3e7c85a26eec.png" style="margin: 0;"></img> to open the **Windows PowerShell** window.
2. Execute the following command to check the remote desktop running status (in default status, the remote desktop service port is 3389).
```
netstat -ant | findstr 3389
```
 - If a result similar to the following is returned, this indicates that the status is normal. You can [restart the remote desktop](#F4) and try again to remotely connect to the instance to check whether the connection is successful.

 - If no connection appears, this indicates the status is exceptional. You can [check whether the remote ports of the registry are correct](#F5).

### Checking Whether the Remote Ports in the Registry are Consistence

> This step guides you to check whether the **TCP PortNumber** and **RDP Tcp PortNumer** are the same.
>
1. In the CVM, click <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/87d894e564b7e837d9f478298cf2e292.png" style="margin: 0;"></img>, select <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/5b5e3abb2f39cb719a4119ba77b74447.png" style="margin: 0;"></img>, and enter **regedit**. Press **Enter** to open the **Registry Editor** window.
2. In the registry navigation on the left, expand the following directories in order: **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE** > **SYSTEM** > **CurrentControlSet** > **Control** > **Terminal Server** > **Wds** > **rdpwd** > **Tds** > **tcp**.
3. In **tcp** locate PortNumber and note down the port number (3389 by default) as shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/e67b696fd25b3355c9038f99a08b90be.png)
4. In the registry navigation on the left, expand the following directories in order: **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE** > **SYSTEM** > **CurrentControlSet** > **Control** > **Terminal Server** > **WinStations** > **RDP-Tcp**.
5. In **RDP-Tcp** locate PortNumber and check whether the PortNumber data in **RDP-Tcp** is the same as the one in **tcp**. This is shown in the following figure:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/8240dd43dcb3ca246caf3397e4a1e84f.png)
 - If they are not the same, execute [Step 6](#F5_step6).
 - If they are the same, [restart the remote login service](#F4).
6. Double click PortNumber in **RDP-Tcp**.
7. In the dialog box that pops up, modify **Value data** to a port number between 0 - 65535 that are not occupied, making the **TCP PortNumber** and **RDP Tcp PortNumer** port numbers maintain consistency, and click **OK**.
7. After modification, restart the instance in the [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm), and try connect remotely to the instance again and check whether the connection is successful.
