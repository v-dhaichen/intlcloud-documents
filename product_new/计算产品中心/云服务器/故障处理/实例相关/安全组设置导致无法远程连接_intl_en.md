This document introduces how to troubleshoot the problem where unable to connect remotely to a CVM due to security group configuration issues.

## Diagnostic Tool

You can use the [Port Verification](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/helper) to check whether the problem is caused by security group configurations.
1. Log in to the [Port Verification](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/helper).
2. In the **Port Verification** page, select the instance to check and click **Quick Check**. This is shown in the following figure:

If the check shows that the instance has ports that are not open to the Internet, you can use the **Open All Ports** function to open all the commonly used ports of the CVM to the Internet, and then try to remotely connect again.

## Modifying Security Group Configurations

If you do not want to use the **Open All Ports** function to open all the commonly used ports of the CVM to the Internet, or you need a custom remote login port, you can also use the custom configuration of the inbound and outbound rules of the security group to resolve the inability to log in issue.
