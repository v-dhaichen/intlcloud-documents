## Microservice Architecture
The microservice architecture is suitable for creating complex applications. It splits your monolithic application into multiple micro-services across different dimensions, and the content of each micro-service can be managed by a Docker image.

### Advantages of Deploying Microservice by Using Tencent Cloud TKE
- Cluster management is simplified and cluster installation is not required.
- Seamlessly connects to Tencent Cloud's computing, network, storage, monitoring, security capabilities, and directly uses Tencent Cloud's IaaS capability.
- It is easy to use, and supports service arrangement and application management at service granularity. Resources are highly isolated while services are highly available.

The following figure shows the microservice architecture:

## Continuous Integration and Delivery
An excellent DevOps environment is provided through continuous integration and continuous delivery to greatly increase the efficiency of software release.
### Continuous Integration
Allows developers to complete building and (unit) testing processes immediately after submitting new codes. According to test results, you can determine whether new codes and original codes can be properly integrated.
### Continuous Delivery
Based on continuous integration, the integrated codes will be deployed in the operating environment.
### Advantages
By deploying services on Tencent Cloud TKE, developers can perform such operations as building, testing, packaging, and integration immediately after submitting new codes. Then, they deploy the integrated codes into the pre-release environment and live environment through continuous integration.

The following figure shows the process of continuous integration and continuous delivery.
