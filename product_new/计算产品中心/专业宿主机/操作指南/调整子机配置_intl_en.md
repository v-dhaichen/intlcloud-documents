You can adjust configuration of the Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM) on a dedicated host to meet service requirements during different periods. The configuration adjustment range is limited by the number of available resources on the dedicated host.

## Notes
- When the CVM is in the **shutdown** state, you can adjust configuration of the CVM in the console directly.
- When the CVM is in the **running** state, you must forcibly shut down the CVM before configuration adjustment.

## Steps

1. Log in to the [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/).
2. Find the target instance, and click **More** -> **Resource Adjustment** -> **Adjust Configuration** in the **Operation** column on the right, see the figure below.
