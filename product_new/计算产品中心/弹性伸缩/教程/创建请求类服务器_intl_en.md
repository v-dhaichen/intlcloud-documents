The active outbound CVMs require timeliness. In this case, the Auto Scaling service can facilitate the rapid creation, deployment, and scale-in of the request CVMs.
If you have a clear idea about the time need to scale in an out, you can set a scheduled scaling policy to automatically add or remove CVM instances at the specified time, eliminating the need for manual operation and reducing your deployment and instance costs.
