AS can predict exceptions and send alarm in advance.

In some cases, such as insufficient balance or mistaken deletion of image, it is impossible to create the CVMs needed in a scale-out. AS can predict these exceptions and sends an alarm. This allows you to identify risks before scaling activity fails, preventing losses.
