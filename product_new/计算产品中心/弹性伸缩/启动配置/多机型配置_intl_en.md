## Scenario
Different instance types are available for different availability zones. A selected model may have been sold out or have a configuration issue in the current availability zone. Multiple-model configuration helps you effectively resolve this problem.

Multiple-model configuration has the following features:
- Effectively reduces the risk of scale-out failure resulting from sell-out or instance calling failure.
- Recommends multiple models with configurations, prices, and performance similar to those of your preferred model, and intelligently selects a model with adequate stock for you when your preferred model is sold out.
