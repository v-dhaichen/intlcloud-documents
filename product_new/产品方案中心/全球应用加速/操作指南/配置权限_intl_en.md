A root account with GAAP permissions or other accounts with AdministratorAccess permissions can assign collaborator accounts with GAAP read-write or read-only permissions by configuring access management.

The user can grant permissions to collaborator accounts by two methods: associating a policy with a user, or associating a user with a policy. For more information, see [Cloud Access Management (CAM)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/597/17989).

2. In the top navigation, select **Products**>**Management & Audit**>**[Cloud Access Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/policy)** to enter the CAM console.
