## 1.  Terms and Definitions

1.1  **Cloud** **Block Storage (CBS)**: means a persistent block storage service provided by Tencent Cloud for cloud servers. You may access reading and writing operations by mounting CBS to CVM cloud servers. For details, please refer to the Service you purchase, and the contents of the Service provided by Tencent Cloud.

1.2  **Service Month(s)**: means the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you. For example, if you purchase the Service for a term of three months starting from March 17, there will be four (4) Service Months (the first Service Month from March 17 to March 31, the second from April 1 to April 30, the third from May 1 to May 31, and the fourth from June 1 to June 16). The availability of the Service will be calculated independently for each Service Month.

1.3  **Total Time of a Single CBS Instance within a Service Month**: the total number of days of the Service Month for a Single CBS Instance × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes).

1.4  **Single CBS Instance Service Downtime within a Service Month**: If (and only if) the access to a single CBS instance continuously fails within one (1) minute, it shall be deemed that the Service with respect to such instance is unavailable within such one (1) minute. If the duration of inaccessibility is less than one (1) minute, such period will not be counted into the Service downtime. The accumulated Service downtime so calculated in minutes of a single CBS instance within a Service Month is the Single CBS Instance Service Downtime within a Service Month.

1.5  **CBS Monthly Service Fee**: means the aggregate service fees paid by a user for a single CBS instance under a Tencent Cloud account within one (1) Service Month, excluding the portion paid yet to be consumed, and the portion deducted by a voucher or promotional voucher, due to discounted service fee or otherwise deducted.

## 2.  Service Availability / Service Uptime Metrics

2.1  **Calculation of Service Availability**

Service Availability of CBS service is calculated on a single CBS instance basis as follows:

**Service Availability = (Total Time of a Single CBS Instance within a Service Month - Single CBS Instance Service Downtime within a Service Month) / Total Time of a Single CBS Instance within a Service Month × 100%**

2.2  **Standard of Service Availability/ Service Metrics**

**The Service Availability of the Service will be** **no less than 99.95%**. You are entitled to the compensation as set forth in Section 3 below if the Service Availability fails to meet the aforementioned standard, other than in any circumstance as provided for in the release of liabilities provisions below.

*If a Service Month has thirty (30) days, the total available time of a single CBS instance in such month will be 43,178.4 minutes (= 30 (days) × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes) × 99.95%); that is, there may be 21.6 minutes (= 43,200 minutes -- 43,178.4 minutes) Service downtime of the instance in such month.*

## 3.  Service Compensation

In respect of this Service, if the Service Availability fails to meet the abovementioned standard, you will be entitled to compensations in accordance with the following terms:

3.1  **Standards of Compensation**

(1) Compensations will be made **in the form of voucher** by Tencent Cloud, and you should follow the rules for using the voucher (including the valid term; for details, please refer to the rules of vouchers published on Tencent Cloud's official website). You cannot redeem such voucher for cash or request to issue an invoice for such voucher. Such voucher can only be used to purchase the Service by using your Tencent Cloud account. You cannot use the voucher to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the voucher to a third party for consideration or for free.

(2) If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the standard, the amount of compensation will be calculated for such month independently, and **the aggregate amount shall be no more than the applicable Monthly Service Fee paid by you for such month** (the Monthly Service Fee referred to herein shall exclude the portion deducted by a voucher or promotional credit, due to discounted service fee or otherwise deducted).

|**Service Availability (Av) for a Service Month**|   **Value of Compensation Voucher**|
|-|-|
|99.95% \> Av ≥ 99%|                                  10% of the Monthly Service Fee|
|99% \> Av ≥ 95%|                                     25% of the Monthly Service Fee|
|95% \> Av|                                           100% of the Monthly Service Fee|

3.2  **Time Limit for Compensation Application**

(1) If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the abovementioned Service Availability standard, you may apply for compensation **through (and only through) the support ticket system under your relevant account** after the fifth (5^th^) business day of the month immediately following such Service Month. Tencent Cloud will verify and ascertain your application upon receipt of such application. If there is any dispute over the calculation of the Service Availability for a Service Month, **both parties agree that the back-end record of Tencent Cloud will prevail**.

(2) **You should apply for such compensation no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the expiry of the applicable Service Month in which the Service Availability fails to meet the standard**. If you fail to make any application within such period, or make the application after such period, or make the application by any means other than that agreed herein, it shall be deemed that you have voluntarily waived your right to apply for such compensation and any other rights you may have against Tencent Cloud, in which case Tencent Cloud has the right to reject your application for compensation and not to make any compensation to you.
