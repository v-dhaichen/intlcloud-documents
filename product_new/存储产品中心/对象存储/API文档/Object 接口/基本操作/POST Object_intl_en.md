## Description
This API (POST Object) is used to upload a file (object) to the specified bucket through the use of a form. This operation requires that you have write permission to the bucket. All API parameters carried by the HTTP header are requested through form fields.

#### Version

If versioning is enabled for the bucket, the POST operation will automatically generate a unique version ID for the object to be uploaded. COS returns this ID in the response using the x-cos-version-id response header.
If you suspend versioning for the bucket, COS will always use "null" as the version ID of the object stored in the bucket.

#### Detail Analysis
1. You need to have write permission to the bucket.
2. If a file with the same name as the file to be uploaded already exists in the bucket, it will be overwritten and a success will be returned as if the upload succeeded.

## Request
#### Sample Request

```shell
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: <BucketName-APPID>.cos.<Region>.myqcloud.com
Content-Length: length
Headers
Form
```

#### Request Header

##### Common Headers

The implementation of this request operation uses a common request header. For more information on common request headers, see [Common Request Headers](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7728).

##### Non-common Headers
The following request headers are required for the implementation of this request operation:

| Name | Description | Type | Required |
|:---|:-- |:---|:-- |
| Content-Length | HTTP request length in bytes as defined in RFC 2616 | String | Yes |

Note: Currently, there can be up to 1,000 entries in one ACL. If you do not need access control for the object, use "default" for this parameter or simply leave it blank, so that the object will inherit the permission of the bucket</td>

#### Signature Protection

If signature protection is needed for an HTTP POST request as a form, the form should contain the content of the following form-data:

| Form Field | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| policy | Base64-encrypted policy content, which is used to verify the content of the request. If the request content does not match the conditions specified by the policy, the request will be rejected. |
| q-sign-algorithm | Algorithm for calculating the signature. COS currently supports SHA1. Enter "sha1" (in lowercase) here. |
| q-ak | Your account ID in Tencent Cloud, i.e., SecretId |
| q-key-time | The validity start and end time of the key used to request the signature, which should be described by a Unix timestamp in seconds in the format of `[start-seconds];[end-seconds]`, <br>such as `1480932292;1481012298` |
| q-signature | Request signature calculated using the elements above. COS will verify the form elements against the signing information and reject the request if the signature does not match the signed content |

#### Signature Calculation

The signature "q-signature" can be calculated in three steps:

1. Use the key content to encrypt the time value of q-key-time and calculate the value of SignKey.
2. Create a POST request policy and encrypt its content with sha1 to get the StringToSign.
3. Encrypt the StringToSign with the SignKey to generate the signature.

#### Policy
Below is a sample of a complete policy:

```shell
{ "expiration": "2007-12-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "conditions": [
    {"acl": "public-read" },
    {"bucket": "examplebucket-1250000000" },
    ["starts-with", "$key", "user/eric/"],
    {"q-sign-algorithm": "sha1" },
    {"q-ak": "AKIDQjz3ltompVjBni5LitkWHFlFpwkn9U5q" },
    {"q-sign-time": "1480932292;1481012298" }
  ]
}
```

**Expiration**
This sets the expiration time for the POST policy in ISO8601 GMT time, such as 2017-12-01T12:00:00.000Z

**Conditions Rules**

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Full match | Expressed with `{"key": "value"}` or `["eq", "$key", "value"]` |
| Prefix match | Expressed with `["starts-with", "$key", "value"]`, where the value can be left blank |
| Range match | Only for `["content-length-range", int1, int2]`. The number of file bytes must be between int1 and int2 |

**Conditions Parameters**
All parameters are optional. If they are not entered, the verification can be skipped.

| Name | Description | Matching Method |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----- |
| acl | Permitted scope for the file's ACL attribute. This is optional | Full, prefix |
| bucket | This specifies the bucket to upload to | Full |
| content-length-range | This specifies the upload size range of the file | Range |
| key | Object storage path | Full, prefix |
| success_action_redirect | URL returned after a successful upload | Full, prefix |
| success_action_status | Status returned after successful upload | Full |
| x-cos-meta-\* | This includes the suffix and information of the user-defined header, which will be returned as the object metadata of up to 2 KB. <br>Note: User-defined header information can contain underscores, but user-defined header suffixes cannot | Full, prefix |
| x-cos-\* | Other COS headers that need to be signed | Full |
