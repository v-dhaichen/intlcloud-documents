## Overview

This API (COS Select) is used to extract the content from the specified object (in CSV or JSON format) using Structured Query Language (SQL) statements. During the extraction process, you need to specify the content delimiter and use an appropriate SQL function. COS Select will return the matching extraction result, and you can specify the save format of the result.

For more information on COS Select, see COS [Select Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/32472). For more information on the SQL expressions of COS Select, see [SELECT Command](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/32473) in the Developer Guide.

#### Permission Restrictions

To use COS Select, you must have the permission to `cos:GetObject`.

- If you are using a root account, you have the permission by default.
- If you are using a sub-account, contact your root account to get the permission to this operation. For more information on permission settings, see [Granting a Sub-account Access to COS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/11714).

#### Object Data Format

COS Select supports extracting object data in the following formats:

- CSV: An object is stored in CSV format with its data records separated with a specific delimiter.
- JSON: An object is stored in JSON format, which can be either a JSON file or a JSON list.

> 
> - CSV and JSON objects need to be encoded in UTF-8.
> - COS Select supports extracting CSV and JSON objects compressed by gzip or bzip2.
> - COS Select supports extracting CSV and JSON objects encrypted with SSE-COS.

The following table shows the composition of the elements in a request body:

| Node Name | Parent Node | Description | Type | Required |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | -------- |
| Expression | SelectRequest | An SQL expression that represents the extraction operation which you need to initiate, such as `SELECT s._1 FROM COSObject s`. This expression extracts the first column of content from a CSV object. For more information on SQL expressions, see [SELECT Command](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/32473). | String | Yes |

| InputSerialization | SelectRequest | Describes the format of the object to be extracted| Container | Yes |
| OutputSerialization | SelectRequest | Describes the output format of the extraction result. | Container | Yes |
| RequestProgress | SelectRequest | Whether to return the query progress information (QueryProgress). If this parameter is selected, COS Select will periodically return the query progress information. | Container | No |

**InputSerialization container element**

| Node Name | Parent Node | Description | Type | Required |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| CompressionType | InputSerialization | Describes the compression format of the object to be extracted: <br><li>If the object has not been compressed, this parameter is NONE<br><li>If the object has been compressed, COS Select currently supports gzip and bzip2 formats. Value range: NONE, GZIP, and BZIP2. Default value: NONE. | String | No |
| CSV/JSON | InputSerialization | Describes the required file parameters under the corresponding object format. For example, for CSV format, the delimiter needs to be specified. | Container | Yes<br>CSV or JSON |

**CSV container element (`InputSerialization` sub-element)**

| Node Name | Parent Node | Description | Type | Required |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| RecordDelimiter | CSV | A character that separates the data records in a CSV object into different rows, which is `\n` by default. You can specify any octal character such as a comma, semicolon, and tab. This parameter supports up to 2 bytes, i.e., you can enter a delimiter in the format of `\r\n`. Default value: `\n `. | String | No |
| FieldDelimiter | CSV | Specifies the character separating rows in a CSV object, which is `,` by default. You can specify any octal character. This parameter supports up to 1 byte. Default value: `, `. | String | No |
| QuoteCharacter | CSV | If there is a string in the CSV object to be extracted that contains delimiters, you can use `QuoteCharacter` to escape it so as to prevent it from being cut into several parts. For example, if there is a string ` "a, b" ` in the CSV object, double quotation mark `"` can prevent this string from being separated into two characters (`a` and `b`). Default value: `" `. | String | No |
| QuoteEscapeCharacter | CSV | If the string to be extracted contains `"`, then you need to use `"` to escape it so as to ensure that the string can be escaped normally. For example, your string `""" a , b """` will be parsed as `" a , b "`. Default value: `"`. | String | No |
| AllowQuotedRecordDelimiter | CSV | Specifies whether the object to be extracted contains any character that is the same as the delimiter and needs to be escaped using `"`. When this parameter is set to TRUE, COS Select will escape the character during extraction, which will result in a decrease in the extraction performance. When it is set to FALSE, no escaping will be performed. Default value: FALSE. | Boolean | No |
| FileHeaderInfo | CSV | Whether the object to be extracted contains a column header. Value range: NONE, USE, IGNORE. NONE indicates that the object contains no column headers, USE indicates that the object contains a column header and you can use the head for extraction (such as `SELECT "name" FROM COSObject`), and IGNORE indicates that the object contains a column header and you do not intend to use the header for extraction (but you can still use the column index for extraction, such as `SELECT s._1 FROM COSObject s`). | Enum | No |
| Comments | CSV | Specifies a record as a comment line. This character is added to the first character of the record. If a record is specified as a comment, COS Select will not perform any analysis on it. Default value: `#`. | String | No |

**JSON container element (`InputSerialization` sub-element)**

| Node Name | Parent Node | Description | Type | Required |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | -------- |

**CSV container element (`OutputSerialization` sub-element)**

| Node Name | Parent Node | Description | Type | Required |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | -------- |
| QuoteFields | CSV | Specifies whether the output result needs to be escaped with `"` if it is a file. Value range: ALWAYS, ASNEEDED. ALWAYS indicates applying `"` to all the output extracted files, and ASNEEDED indicates using it only when needed. Default value: is ASNEEDED. | String | Yes |
| RecordDelimiter | CSV | A character that separates the data records in the output result into different rows, which is `\n` by default. You can specify any octal character such as a comma, semicolon, and tab. This parameter supports up to 2 bytes, i.e., you can enter a delimiter in the format of `\r\n`. Default value: `\n `. | String | No |
| FieldDelimiter | CSV | A character that separates each row in the output result into different columns, which is `,` by default. You can specify any octal character. This parameter supports up to 1 byte. Default value: `, `. | String | No |
| QuoteCharacter | CSV | If there is a string in the output result that contains delimiters, you can use `QuoteCharacter` to escape it so as to ensure that the string will not be cut in subsequent analysis. For example, if there is a string `a, b` in the output result, double quotation mark `"` can prevent this string from being separated into two characters (`a` and `b`), and COS Select will convert it to `"a , b"` to be written to the file. Default value: `" `. | String | No |
| QuoteEscapeCharacter | CSV | If the string to be output contains `"`, then you need to use `"` to escape it so as to ensure that the string can be escaped normally. For example, your string `" a , b"` will be converted to `""" a , b """` when written to the file. Default value: `" `. | String | No |

**JSON container element (`OutputSerialization` sub-element)**

## Response

A successful extraction operation will return a `200 OK` status code.

#### Response Header

This API only returns a common response header. For more information, see [Common Response Headers](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7729).

#### Response Body

As the size of the response body is unpredictable, COS presents the response body in serialized form, i.e., dividing the response body into multiple parts to be returned. The following shows an overview of the returned response body:

```shell
<Message 1>
<Message 2>
<Message 3>
......
<Message n>
```

#### Pre-response (Prelude) and Response Result (Data)

COS cuts a extraction result into multiple parts, each of which is a message. Each message consists the pre-response (prelude) and response result (data).

- The prelude consists of two parts:
 - Total length of the message.
  - Total length of all headers.
- The data consists of two parts:
  - Header.
  - Payload.

Both the prelude and data end with a 4-byte CRC code encoded in Big Endian. COS Select uses CRC32 to calculate the CRC code. For more information on CRC32, see the [RFC documentation](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt). In addition to data, COS Select additionally spends a total of 16 bytes in transferring the prelude and code.

> The integer values in all the messages are transferred in network byte order (i.e., encoded in Big Endian).

The figure below shows what a message and a header consist of. One message may contain multiple headers.
![Message construction](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/854fe989e1f98b168a038b4fb615d4e5.png)

As shown above, each message consists of a prelude, a prelude CRC code (composed of two pieces of information that record the number of bytes), header(s), a payload, and a message CRC code. As can be seen from the above figure, the length of the entire response body is calculated as follows:
```
Total length of a response body = Length of the prelude + length of the prelude CRC code + length of the payload + length of the header(s) + length of the message CRC code
```

As the total length of the prelude, the prelude CRC code and the message CRC code is always 16 bytes, the total length of the response body can also be quickly calculated as follows:
```
Total length of a response body = Length of the payload + length of the header(s) + 16
```

The following describes the components of the response body in detail:

| Component | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| prelude | Records the total length of each message and the total length of all headers separately. Each record is of 4 bytes, and the total length is 8 bytes: <br>1. `total byte-length`: the total length of the message, which is encoded in Big Endian and of 4 bytes in total with the capacity of the record itself included. <br>2. `headers byte-length`: the total length of all headers, which is encoded in Big Endian and of 4 bytes in total with the capacity occupied by the record excluded. |
| prelude CRC | A prelude CRC is encoded in Big Endian and contains a total of 4 bytes. It helps the program quickly determine whether the prelude information is correct so as to reduce blocking during buffering. |
| header | Metadata of the extraction result recorded by the message, such as data type and body format. The length of this part in bytes varies by data type. A header is stored as a key-value (KV) pair and encoded in UTF-8. The metadata recorded in a header can be displayed in any order, but each metadata entry is recorded only once. Depending on the data type, the following headers may appear in the result returned by COS Select: <br>1. `MessageType Header`: This header represent the response type, where the key is ":message-type" and the value can be "error" or "event". "error" indicates that this record is an error message, and "event" indicates that this record is a specific event. <br>2. `EventType Header`: This header records the event type, where the key is ":event-type" and the value can be "Records", "Cont", "Progress", "Stats" or "End". "Records" indicates that the event is the returned extraction record, "Cont" the TCP connection hold, "Progress" the periodically returned extraction result, "Stats" the statistics of the query, and "End" the end of query. <br>3. `ErrorCode Header`: This header records the error code, where the key is ":error-code" and the value can be an error code listed in [Special Error Codes](#.E7.89.B9.E6.AE.8A.E9.94.99.E8.AF.AF.E7.A0.81). <br>4. `ErrorMessage Header`: This header records the error message, where the key is ":error-message" and the value can be an error message returned by the server, which can be used to locate the error. |
| Payload | Records the extraction result or official information related to the request. |
| Message CRC | CRC code encoded in Big Endian containing a total of 4 bytes. |

A message may record multiple headers, and each header consists of the following parts:

| Component | Description |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Header Name Byte-Length | Records the length of the header name in bytes |
| Header Name | Header type. Value range: ":message-type", ":event-type", ":error-code", ":error-message" <br><li>":message-type" indicates that the header records the response type <br><li> ":event-type" indicates that the header records the event type <br><li>":error-code" indicates that the header records the error code <br><li>" :error-message" indicates that the header records the error message. |
| Header Value Type | Type of the header value, which is always 7 for COS Select, indicating that the type is String |
| Value String Byte-Length | Length of the header value in bytes, which is always 2 bytes |
| Header Value String | Body of the header, i.e., the metadata of the payload, where the length of the header value in bytes depends on the response type |

COS Select supports the following response types:

| Response Type | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Records message | An extraction record message, which can contain a single record, a partial record, or multiple records, depending on the number of extraction results. A response body may contain multiple records messages |
| Continuation message | A connection continuation message that is sent by COS Select periodically to maintain the TCP connection and appears randomly in the response body. It is recommended to make your client able to automatically identify this type of messages and filter them out so as to avoid smudging the extraction results |
| Progress message | A progress message returned by COS Select periodically to indicate the current query progress |
| Stats message | A statistics message about the query returned by COS Select after the query ends |
| End message | An end message indicating that the query has ended and there is no subsequent response data. The query can be considered to have ended only when a message of this type is received |
| RequestLevelError message | An error message which will be returned by COS Select when an error occurs during the query process and contains the cause of the error. If COS Select returns this message, it will not return an end message |

These response types are as detailed below.

## Samples

#### Sample 1. Extracting Content from an Object in CSV Format

The following sample shows the process of calling this API to extract all the content from a CSV object and outputting the extraction result in CSV format. The object to be extracted is named `exampleobject.csv` and stored in the bucket examplebucket-1250000000 in Beijing (ap-beijing).

```shell
POST /exampleobject.csv?select&select-type=2 HTTP/1.1
Host: examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com
Date: Tue, 12 Jan 2019 11:49:52 GMT
Authorization: authorization string
Content-Length: content length

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<SelectRequest>
    <Expression>Select * from COSObject</Expression>
    <ExpressionType>SQL</ExpressionType>
    <InputSerialization>
        <CompressionType>None</CompressionType>
        <CSV>
            <FileHeaderInfo>IGNORE</FileHeaderInfo>
            <RecordDelimiter>\n</RecordDelimiter>
            <FieldDelimiter>,</FieldDelimiter>
            <QuoteCharacter>"</QuoteCharacter>
            <QuoteEscapeCharacter>"</QuoteEscapeCharacter>
            <Comments>#</Comments>
        </CSV>
    </InputSerialization>
    <OutputSerialization>
        <CSV>
            <QuoteFields>ASNEEDED</QuoteFields>
            <RecordDelimiter>\n</RecordDelimiter>
            <FieldDelimiter>,</FieldDelimiter>
            <QuoteCharacter>"</QuoteCharacter>
            <QuoteEscapeCharacter>"</QuoteEscapeCharacter>
        </CSV>                               
    </OutputSerialization>
</SelectRequest> 
```

If you need to execute different extraction commands, you can modify the SQL command in the `Expression` element. For more information on commands, see [SELECT Command](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7730). Some common extraction scenarios are described below.

- Suppose that you use a column index to filter the content of an object. You can use `s._n` to filter out the data in the `n` column, with the minimum value of `n` being 1. The following command will filter out the records in column 3 with a value greater than 100 from the object and return columns 1 and 2 of those records: 
```shell
SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM COSObject s WHERE s._3 > 100
```

- If your CSV object has a column header and you want to filter the content of the object using the name of the header (by setting `FileHeaderInfo` to `Use`), you can use `s.name` for indexing. The following command will filter out records with a header named `Id` or `FirstName`:
```shell
SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName FROM COSObject s
```

- You can also specify a function in the SQL expression. The following command will count the number of records in the first column that are smaller than 1:
```shell
SELECT count(*) FROM COSObject s WHERE s._1 < 1
```

The following is a sample response:

```shell
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
x-cos-id-2: cos_id_demo
x-cos-request-id: cos_request_id_demo
Date: Tue, 12 Jan 2019 11:50:29 GMT

A series of messages
```

#### Sample 2. Extracting Content from an Object in JSON Format

The following sample shows the process of calling this API to extract all the content from a JSON object and outputting the extraction result in CSV format. The object to be extracted is named `exampleobject.json` and stored in the bucket examplebucket-1250000000 in Beijing (ap-beijing).

```shell
POST /exampleobject.json?select&select-type=2 HTTP/1.1
Host: examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com
Date: Tue, 12 Jan 2019 11:52:29 GMT
Authorization: authorization string
Content-Length: content length

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<SelectRequest>
    <Expression>Select * from COSObject</Expression>
    <ExpressionType>SQL</ExpressionType>
    <InputSerialization>
        <CompressionType>NONE</CompressionType>
        <JSON>
            <Type>DOCUMENT</Type>
        </JSON>
    </InputSerialization>
    <OutputSerialization>
        <CSV>
            <QuoteFields>ASNEEDED</QuoteFields>
            <RecordDelimiter>\n</RecordDelimiter>
            <FieldDelimiter>,</FieldDelimiter>
            <QuoteCharacter>"</QuoteCharacter>
            <QuoteEscapeCharacter>"</QuoteEscapeCharacter>
        </CSV>                               
    </OutputSerialization>
</SelectRequest> 
```

Similarly, you can also perform different extraction commands on JSON objects by modifying the SQL command in the `Expression` element. For more information on commands, see [SELECT Command](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/32473). Some common extraction scenarios are described below.

- You can extract the corresponding data using the JSON attribute name. The following command will filter out records whose `city` value is Seattle from the object and return the `country` and `city` information of those records:
```shell
SELECT s.country, s.city from COSObject s where s.city = 'Seattle'
```

- You can also specify a function in the SQL expression. The following command will count the total number of records in the JSON object:
```shell
SELECT count(*) FROM COSObject s
```

## Notes

Unlike the [GET Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7753) API, SELECT Object Content does not support the following features:

- Returning a part of an object: You cannot use parameters such as `Range` to specify to return a part of an object.
- Manipulating archived objects (in ARCHIVE storage class). COS Select cannot directly manipulate archived objects. To do so, you need to retrieve the data first.
