## Description

This API (PUT Bucket) is used to create a bucket under the specified account. This API does not support anonymous requests; therefore, to create a bucket, you need to use a request with the Authorization signature. A user who creates a bucket will be the bucket owner by default.

> When creating a bucket, if no access permission is specified, the private read/write (private) permission will be used by default.
