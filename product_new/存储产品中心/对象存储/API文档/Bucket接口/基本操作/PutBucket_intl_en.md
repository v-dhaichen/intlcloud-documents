## Description

This API is used to create a bucket under a specified account. This API does not support anonymous requests; only a request carrying the Authorization signature can create a new bucket. The bucket creator is the bucket owner by default.

> If no access permission is specified for a bucket when it is created, the private Read/Write (private) access will be used by default.
