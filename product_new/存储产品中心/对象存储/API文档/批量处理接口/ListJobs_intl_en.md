## Feature Description

This API is used to list your batch operation jobs. For more information on batch operation, please see [Batch Operation Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/32958).

## Request

**Sample Request**

```shell
GET /jobs?jobStatuses=<JobStatuses>&maxResults=<MaxResults>&nextToken=<NextToken> HTTP/1.1
x-cos-appid: <appid>
```

**Request Parameters**

Calling the `ListJobs` API requires the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |
| jobStatuses | Status of the job to be queried. If no status is specified, COS will return all jobs, including those in progress; otherwise, only jobs in the specified status will be returned. Valid values: Active, Cancelled, Cancelling, Complete, Completing, Failed, Failing, New, Paused, Pausing, Preparing, Ready, Suspended. | No  |
| maxResults  | Maximum number of jobs to be returned by COS. If this parameter is configured, the number of jobs returned each time will not exceed its value. If it is used together with the `nextToken` parameter, COS can return the results in multiple pages. Value range: 1–1,000. Default value: 1,000. | No |
| nextToken | Page break with a length of 1–64 bytes. Each `ListJobs` call will return the last `JobId` in the job list as `nextToken`. You can pass in the `nextToken` in the next `ListJobs` call for COS to list jobs starting from the end of the previous list. In this way, the results can be returned in multiple pages. | Yes |
| x-cos-appid | User APPID with a length of 1–64 bytes. | Yes |
