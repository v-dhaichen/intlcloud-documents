Billable items in COS include [storage capacity](#jf1), [requests](#jf2), [data retrievals](#jf3), [traffic](#jf4), and [administrative features](#jf5) as shown below:

COS offers three object storage classes for different access frequencies: standard storage, standard_IA storage, and archive storage. For more information, please see [COS Storage Classes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30925).

#### Billing restrictions

1. Standard_IA storage class: if the storage duration is less than 30 days, it will be calculated as 30 days. If a single file stored is less than 64 KB, it will be calculated as 64 KB; otherwise, it will be calculated as the actual size.
2. Archive storage class: this storage class is available in public cloud regions only. If the storage duration is less than 90 days, it will be calculated as 90 days. If a single file stored is less than 64 KB, it will be calculated as 64 KB; otherwise, it will be calculated as the actual size.
3. If you upload an object in standard_IA or archive storage class with versioning not enabled, COS will delete the existing object of the **same name** (if any), and in this case, storage fees will still be incurred by **earlier deletion of the object**.

## Request Fees

Request fees include the fees incurred by the **user requests** and the **backend requests** generated by feature configuration.

- User requests: you can perform upload, download, query, deletion, and other data-related operations through API, SDK, console, or related tool programs by sending request commands to Tencent COS.
- Backend requests: these include requests generated by object lifecycle transition, deletion of expired archive storage object copies that were restored to standard storage before, reads/writes during cross-region replication, and delivery of inventory reports.

      <td nowrap="nowrap"><li>Settled on a monthly basis<br><li>If the accumulated number of requests is below 10,000, it will be calculated as 10,000 requests<br><li>Request fees = unit price per 10,000 requests * monthly accumulated number of requests / 10,000 (rounded down)</td>
   </tr>
</table>

#### Billing restrictions

1. Both successful and failed requests are billable.
2. 10,000 requests serve as the smallest counting unit for request fees; therefore, if the number of monthly accumulated requests is below 10,000 it will be calculated as 10,000 requests, no matter whether a request succeeds or fails.
3. When archived data is read, the data is first restored to standard storage class and then read there; therefore, the number of requests is counted in the standard storage class.

## Data Retrieval Fees



| Billable Item | Applicable Storage Class | Meaning | Description |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data retrieved | Standard_IA <br /> Archive | Calculated based on the amount of data retrieved | <li>Settled on a monthly basis <br /><li>Data retrieval fees = unit price per GB * monthly amount of data retrieved |

#### Billing restrictions

**Standard_IA storage** and **archive storage** are storage classes for cold data. You need to retrieve objects first if you want to download and use the objects in these two storage classes. Therefore, traffic fees for downloading data and data retrieval fees will both be incurred.

<span id="jf4"></span>

## Traffic Fees

Traffic fees are calculated based on the accumulated traffic generated by storage data reads.

      <td nowrap="nowrap"><li>Settled on a daily basis <br><li>Global acceleration traffic fees = unit price per GB * daily accumulated global acceleration traffic</td>
   </tr> 
</table>

#### Billing restrictions

1. When archived data is read, the data is first restored to standard storage class and then read there; therefore, the traffic is counted in the Standard storage class.
2. CDN origin-pull traffic refers to the traffic generated by data transfer from COS to Tencent Cloud CDN edge server. If traffic is forwarded from a third-party origin server to COS, public network downstream traffic will be generated.


>
>- Tencent Cloud products within the same region access each other over the private network by default and no traffic fees will be incurred. For more information on how to identify private network access, please see [Private and Public Network Access](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30613).
>- Public network downstream traffic consists of the traffic generated by downloading objects through **object links** and browsing objects through **static website access node**.
>- CDN origin-pull traffic refers to traffic generated by browsing or downloading COS data from the client through **CDN acceleration domain name** after CDN acceleration is enabled.
>- Traffic generated by replication of data in a bucket in one region to another bucket in another region through the copy API or cross-region replication feature is cross-region replication traffic.

#### Traffic direction

The figure below shows the traffic fees incurred by data transferred from COS to end user with CDN acceleration domain name enabled and disabled, respectively.

## Administrative Feature Fees
Administrative feature fees refer to the fees incurred by use of administrative features (such as inventory and extraction) after they are enabled, currently including inventory fees and data extraction fees.

| Billable Item | Applicable Storage Class | Meaning | Description |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Inventory fees | Standard storage<br>Standard_IA storage<br>Archive storage | Fees incurred by inventorying bucket objects after the inventory feature is enabled | <li>Settled on a daily basis <br><li>Billed per million objects inventoried |
| Extraction fees | Standard storage | Fees incurred by scanning objects after the extraction feature is enabled | <li>Settled on a daily basis <br><li>Billed by the size of data scanned |
