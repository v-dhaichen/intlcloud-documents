## Use Cases

With lifecycle configuration, certain predefined actions can be automatically performed when a rule is applied to objects. For example:

- Transition: transition objects to STANDARD_IA storage or ARCHIVE storage after a specified time of period.
- Expiration: automatically delete objects after their specified expiration time.
