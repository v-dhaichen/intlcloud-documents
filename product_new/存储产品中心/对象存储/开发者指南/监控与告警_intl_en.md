## Overview

COS statistics such as read and write requests and traffic are collected and displayed by [Cloud Monitor](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/248). You can view detailed monitoring data in the Cloud Monitor Console.

>This document describes how to get statistics in the COS Console. For more information on how to use Cloud Monitor APIs to get more detailed data, see [Cloud Monitoring product documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248).
