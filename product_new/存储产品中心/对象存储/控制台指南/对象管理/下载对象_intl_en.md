## Overview
You can download existing objects in a bucket in the COS Console. Specifically, you can download a single object in the console or download multiple objects in batches using the COSBrowser tool.

## Prerequisites
Before downloading an object, make sure that the object already exists in the bucket. If no objects have been uploaded, upload them first as instructed in [Uploading an Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13321).

## Downloading a Single Object
#### Directions
1. Log in to the [COS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5) and click Bucket List on the left sidebar to enter the bucket list page.
2. Find the bucket where the object is stored and click the bucket name to enter the bucket management page.

>- If the bucket where the object is stored is Private Read/Write, a signature will be automatically calculated and added at the end of the address copied here. For more information on how to generate a signature, see [Request Signature](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7778).
>- The temporary link with a signature is valid for one hour from the moment you click to view the **Details**. You can refresh the validity period of the signature by clicking **Refresh**.
