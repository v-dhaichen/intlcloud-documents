## Overview
You can query created buckets quickly using the Cloud Object Storage (COS) Console.

>
>- Before you can access a bucket list with a sub-account, the sub-account must be authorized by the root account. For more information, see [Accessing Bucket List Using a Sub-Account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/17061).
>- List Bucket is independent of bucket permission restrictions. Restricting a sub-account's query to some specific buckets is not supported.

## Directions

1. Log in to the [COS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5). On the left sidebar, click **Bucket List** to open the Bucket List page, which contains all created buckets.

3. When the access permission for the bucket is **Public Read/Write** or **Public Read/Private Write**, a **Public** status is indicated next to the bucket name to alert you to the security risk.
