## Overview
By enabling versioning, you can store multiple versions of an object in a bucket and retrieve, delete, or restore it to a specified version. This helps to recover data that was lost due to accidental deletion or application failure.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [COS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5) and click **Bucket List** in the left sidebar to enter the bucket list page.
2. Click the bucket to be configured for versioning to enter the bucket details page.
