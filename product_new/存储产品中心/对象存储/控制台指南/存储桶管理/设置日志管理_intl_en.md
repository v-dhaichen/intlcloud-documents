## Overview
You can log in to the COS Console to enable log management for a bucket, which records various requests related to **bucket operations**. Log management facilitates  buckets usage and management. 

>- The log management feature is currently only available in four regions including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu.
> - Currently, only the **bucket owner** has permission to set log management, and the **Log Management** configuration item will not be displayed to other users when they log in to the console. 

## Directions
1. Log in to the [COS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5), click **Bucket List** in the left sidebar, and click the source bucket that needs the log management enablement.

4. Confirm that the feature is enabled. Select the destination bucket (i.e., the bucket that stores the logs), and set the key prefix for the log object (e.g., `log/`). After confirming that the entered information is correct, click **Save**. The configuration items are as described below:
 - **Destination Bucket**: the **source bucket ** for which log management is enabled and the **destination bucket ** that stores the logs must be in the same region. It is not recommended to use the source bucket itself as the destination bucket.
 - **Path Prefix**: enter a custom path prefix that makes it easy for you to find the logs.

## Notes
1. To enable the log management feature, you need to create a log role in the CAM Console and grant it read/write permission to the logs of the source bucket.
2. When the log management feature is disabled, if the role is not deleted, its read/write permission to the logs of the source bucket will not be revoked.
