## Overview

You can set server-side encryption for a bucket in the COS Console, so that new objects uploaded to the bucket can be encrypted by default. For more information on bucket encryption, please see [Bucket Encryption Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/33457).

>Currently, the supported bucket encryption method is SSE-COS encryption (i.e., server-side encryption using COS-managed encryption keys). For more information on server-side encryption, please see [Server-side Encryption Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/18145).
