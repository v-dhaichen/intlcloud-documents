 - **Access Permission**: Three access permissions for buckets are available by default: "Private Read/Write", "Public Read/Private Write" and "Public Read/Write". The permission is modifiable after being configured. For more information, see [Bucket Access Permissions](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13315).
