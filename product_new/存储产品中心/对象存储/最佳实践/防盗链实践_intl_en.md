## Overview

COS allows you to configure hotlink protection. This feature can set blacklist and whitelist of access origins to avoid resource hotlinking. This document describes how to configure hotlink protection for a bucket.


## How Does Hotlink Protection Work

Hotlink protection works by checking the Referer address in the request header:

- Referer is a part of the header. When a browser sends a request to a web server, it usually carries a Referer to tell the server which page the request comes from, so that the server can decide to deny or allow the access to resources.
- If you open the file link `https://examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/1.jpg` directly in a browser, the request header will not have a Referer.

For example, in the figure below, the image `1.jpg` is embedded in `https://127.0.0.1/test/test.html`, and a Referer pointing to the access origin will be carried when you access `https://127.0.0.1/test/test.html`:

## Hotlink Protection Case Study

User A uploaded the image resource `1.jpg` to COS, and the accessible link to the image is `https://examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/1.jpg`.
- User A embedded the image in their webpage `https://example.com/index.html` and the image is accessible.
- User B saw the image on user A's webpage and decided to embed it in their own webpage `https://b.com/test/test.html`, and user B's webpage can also display the image properly.
In the above case, user A's image resource `1.jpg` was hotlinked by user B. User A doesn't know that their resource in COS is being used by user B's webpage and suffers from losses caused by extra traffic fees. 


## Solution

In the above [Hotlink Protection Case Study](#fenxi), user A can prevent user B from hotlinking their image by setting hotlink protection in the following way:
1. Set a hotlink protection rule for the bucket "examplebucket-1250000000". There are two methods to prevent user B from hotlinking:
 - Method 1: Configure a blacklist, enter `*.b.com` for the domain name, and save.
 - Method 2: Configure a whitelist mode, enter `*.example.com` for the domain name, and save.
2. After hotlink protection is enabled:
 - The image can be displayed properly when `https://example.com/index.html` is accessed.
 - The image cannot be displayed when `https://b.com/test/test.html` is accessed, as shown below:

## Directions

1. Log in to the [COS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5) and click **Bucket List** on the left sidebar to enter the bucket list page.
2. Select the bucket for which to configure hotlink protection and enter it.

3. Click **Basic Configuration**, find the hotlink protection settings, and click **Edit** to enter the editing state.

4. Enable hotlink protection and configure the list type and domain name. Here, select enablement method 2 as detailed below:
 - **Type**: There are two types: blacklist and whitelist.
    - **Blacklist**: It prohibits domain names in the list to access the default access address of the bucket. If a domain name **in the list** accesses the default access address of the bucket, a 403 error will be returned.
    - **Whitelist**: It prohibits domain names not in the list to access the default access address of the bucket. If a domain name **not in the list** accesses the default access address of the bucket, a 403 error will be returned.
 - **Referer** : Up to 10 domain names can be set and they will be matched by prefix. Domain names, IPs, and wildcard `*` are supported formats (one address per line). Below are configuration rule description and examples:
    - Domain names with IP and port are supported, such as `example.com:8080` and `10.10.10.10:8080`.
    - If `example.com` is configured, addresses prefixed with `example.com` can be hit, such as `example.com/123` and `example.com.cn`.
    - If `example.com` is configured, addresses prefixed with `https://example.com` and `http://example.com` can be hit.
    - If `example.com` is configured, its port domain name can be hit, such as `example.com:8080`. 
    - If `example.com:8080` is configured, domain name `example.com` cannot be hit.
    - If `*.example.com` is configured, its second-level and third-level domain names can be restricted, such as `example.com`, `b.example.com`, and `a.b.example.com`.
> After hotlink protection is **enabled**, the corresponding domain names must be entered.
5. After completing the configuration, click **Save**.
