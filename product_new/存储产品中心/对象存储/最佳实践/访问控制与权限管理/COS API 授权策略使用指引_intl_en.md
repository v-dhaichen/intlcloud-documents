>Note:
>When granting API operations permissions to child users or collaborators, be sure to authorize them according to the business needs and the principle of least privilege. If you directly grant sub-users or collaborators all resources (`resource:*`), or all actions (`action:*`) permissions, there is a data security risk due to excessive permission scope.

## Overview
When COS uses the temporary key service, different permissions should be granted to perform actions on different COS APIs. An action or a set of actions can be specified.

A COS API policy is a JSON string. For example, below is a policy to grant the permission to perform upload operations (including simple upload, form upload, and multipart upload) for objects with the path prefix `doc2` in the bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` in the region "ap-beijing" under the APPID `1250000000`:
```shell
{
	"version": "2.0",
	"statement": [{
			"action": [
				// Simple upload 
				"name/cos:PutObject",
				// Form upload 
				"name/cos:PostObject",
				// Multipart upload: initialize multipart upload 
				"name/cos:InitiateMultipartUpload",
				// Multipart upload: list uploaded parts 
				"name/cos:ListParts",
				// Multipart upload: upload parts 
				"name/cos:UploadPart",
				// Multipart upload: complete the upload of all parts 
				"name/cos:CompleteMultipartUpload",
				// Cancel multipart Upload 
				"name/cos:AbortMultipartUpload"
			],
			"effect": "allow",
			"resource": [
				"qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/doc/*"
			]
		},
		{
			"action": [
				// Download 
				"name/cos:GetObject"
			],
			"effect": "allow",
			"resource": [
				"qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/doc2/*"
			]
		}
	]
}
```

## Service APIs 

### Querying Bucket List

The API is GET Service. To grant this permission, the `action` in the policy should be `name/cos:GetService` and the `resource` should be `*`.

#### Example 

The following policy grants the permission to query the list of buckets:

```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",

      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Bucket APIs

The `resource` in Bucket API policies can be described as follows:

- To perform operations on a bucket in any region, the `resource` should be `*`.
- To perform operations only on a bucket in the specified region, for example, to operate on a bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` in the region `ap-beijing` under the APPID `1250000000`, the `resource` should be `qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/*`.
- To perform operations only on a bucket with the specified name in the specified region, for example, to operate on the bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` in the region `ap-beijing` under the APPID `1250000000`, the `resource` should be `qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/`.

      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/doc/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Pre-requesting Cross-origin Configuration

The API is OPTIONS Object. To grant this permission, the `action` in the policy should be `name/cos:OptionsObject`.

#### Example 

The following policy grants the permission to send an Options request only for objects with the path prefix `doc` in the bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` in the region `ap-beijing` under the APPID `1250000000`:

```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "name/cos:OptionsObject"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/doc/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Restoring an Archived Object

The API is Post Object Restore. To grant this permission, the `action` in the policy should be `name/cos:PostObjectRestore`.

#### Example 

The following policy grants the permission to restore an archived object only with the path prefix `doc` in the bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` in the region `ap-beijing` under the APPID `1250000000`:

```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "name/cos:PostObjectRestore"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/doc/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Deleting a Single Object

The API is DELETE Object. To grant this permission, the `action` in the policy should be `name/cos:DeleteObject`.

#### Example 

The following policy grants the permission to delete only the object `audio.mp3` in the bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` in the region `ap-beijing` under the APPID `1250000000`:

```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "name/cos:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/audio.mp3"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Deleting Multiple Objects

The API is DELETE Multiple Objects. To grant this permission, the `action` in the policy should be `name/cos:DeleteObject`.

#### Example 

The following policy grants the permission to delete only the objects `audio.mp3` and `video.mp4` in batches in the bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` in the region `ap-beijing` under the APPID `1250000000`:

```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "name/cos:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/audio.mp3",
        "qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/video.mp4"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Authorization Policies in Common Scenarios

### Granting Read/Write Access to All Resources
The following policy grants full real-write access to all resources:
```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "*"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Granting Read-only Access to All Resources
The following policy grants the real-only access to all resources:
```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "name/cos:HeadObject",
        "name/cos:GetObject",
        "name/cos:ListObject",
        "name/cos:OptionsObject"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Granting Read/Write Access to Resources with the Specified Path Prefix
The following policy grants the permission to access only files under the path with prefix `doc` in the bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` and does not allow performing operations on the files in other paths.
```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "*"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "qcs::cos:ap-shanghai:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/doc/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
