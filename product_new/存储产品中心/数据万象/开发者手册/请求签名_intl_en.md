Tencent Cloud Infinite (CI) verifies the validity of requests with signatures. Developers authorize a signature to the client to upload, download, and manage specific resources.

With CI, an anonymous HTTP request or signed HTTP request can be made by using the RESTful API. For a signature request, the server will authenticate the initiator.

- Anonymous request: the HTTP request does not include any identity or authentication information, and the HTTP request is made through the RESTful API.
- Signature request: a signature is included in the HTTP request, and authentication is performed after the server receives the request. The request is approved and executed after a successful authentication, otherwise it is discarded with an error message.

CI uses the same signature algorithm as COS because its storage is based on COS. CI is authenticated based on the custom solution for key HMAC (Hash Message Authentication Code), which is the same as COS.

## Signature Algorithm

There are XML and JSON signatures:

- Use **JSON** signatures for the **downloading** operation.
- Use **XML** signatures for the **uploading** and **bucket API** operations. For more information, see XML [Request Signature](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7778).

>
- The host in the downloading request header looks like `<BucketName-APPID>.<picture region>.myqcloud.com/<picture name>`, for example, `examplebucket-1250000000.picsh.myqcloud.com/picture.jpeg`.
- The host in the uploading request header looks like `<BucketName-APPID>.pic.<Region>.myqcloud.com`, for example `examplebucket-1250000000.pic.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/picture.jpeg`.

### Signature tool

The information that is required for generating a signature includes the APPID (such as 1250000000), bucket name (such as examplebucket-ci), and SecretID and SecretKey of the project.

The preceding information can be obtained as follows:
1. Log in to [CI Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ci/index), and click **Bucket Management** in the left sidebar.
2. Select the bucket that you want to manage, and click **Bucket Configuration** to view the bucket name and bucket ID. Create a bucket if the current project does not contain one yet. For more information, see [Creating Buckets](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/33436).

3. Click **Key Management** in the left sidebar. Follow the instructions on the page to go to the API Keys page on Cloud Access Management Console by clicking the hyperlink, and obtain the key.



The signature calculation process in CI is the same as that in COS. 


#### Using signatures

Signed HTTP requests initiated through RESTful APIs can pass signatures in the following ways:

1. Pass through a standard HTTP Authorization header, such as `Authorization: q-sign-algorithm=sha1&q-ak=...&q-sign-time=1557989753;1557996953&...&q-signature=...`
2. Pass as an HTTP request parameter (be sure to implement UrlEncode), such as `/exampleobject?q-sign-algorithm=sha1&q-ak=...&q-sign-time=1557989753%3B1557996953&...&q-signature=...`


>In the preceding example, `...` is used to substitute the specific signing information.
