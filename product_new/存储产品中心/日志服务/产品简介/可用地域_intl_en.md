## Overview

You can create logsets and log topics in different regions when using CLS. Regions refer to the geographical areas of physical IDCs. Networks are completely isolated between regions. You can select the nearest region based on your business scenario and target usersâ€™ geographical location to reduce log access latency and improve access speed. 





## Available regions and their abbreviations

| Region | Abbreviation | Request Domain Name |
| -------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Beijing | ap-beijing | ap-beijing.cls.myqcloud.com |
| Shanghai | ap-shanghai | ap-shanghai.cls.myqcloud.com |
| Guangzhou | ap-guangzhou | ap-guangzhou.cls.myqcloud.com |
| Chengdu | ap-chengdu | ap-chengdu.cls.myqcloud.com |

| Toronto | na-toronto | na-toronto.cls.myqcloud.com |



## Notes

If other cloud products are integrated into CLS, try to select a logset in the same region as the other cloud products. Cloud products in the same region access each other over a private network, which effectively reduces latency and improves access speed.
