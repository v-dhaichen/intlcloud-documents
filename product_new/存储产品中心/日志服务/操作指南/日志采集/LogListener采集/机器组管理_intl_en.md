A server group is a server object configured to collect logs by LogListener in Tencent Cloud CLS. Generally, different server groups are configured based on various business scenarios to help you manage CLS.

> - Enter one IP in a line. Windows system is not supported.
> - If you are using Tencent Cloud servers in the same region, you can enter private IPs directly, with one IP per line.


## Viewing Server Status
The heartbeat mechanism is employed to maintain the connection between the server group and the CLS system. Heartbeat is sent regularly to CLS from the server group with LogListener installed.
1. Click the **View** button to check the status of the server group to see if the server is running normally.
