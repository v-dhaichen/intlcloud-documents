CLS requires a time attribute for each log so that the system can manage the data by the time dimension. When logs are collected using LogListener, the time attribute can be configured using two methods:

- Default method: use LogListener collection time as the time attribute.
- Custom method: use a time field in the log content as the time attribute. In this method, you need to configure a time resolution format.

>The time precision of LogListener collection is the “second”. Therefore, the time resolution format only needs to be accurate to seconds.



## Description of the resolution format
