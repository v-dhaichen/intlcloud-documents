## Overview
The CFS service monitoring plugin is a plugin integrated with the Cloud Monitor component to monitor the performance of CFS file systems and client connections. You are strongly recommended to install it on your clients such as CVM or TKE instances to better manage the CFS service.

>Before installing the plugin, please make sure that your client has the Cloud Monitor component installed. For more information, please see [Installing Cloud Monitor Component](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/6211).

## OS Support

Currently, the CFS service monitoring plugin **supports monitoring of clients mounted with NFS (CIFS/SMB not supported)** and the following operating systems. There may be compatibility issues with other kernel editions of Linux.

#### Feature description

How the plugin works and its key features:

- How it works: the plugin reads data from NFS-related logs in `/proc/self/mountstats` and `/var/log/messages`, including performance, status, and mount parameters but not your actual business data.
- Key features: it reads the status of mount points on the client using CFS, performs mount point availability scans, and collects performance-related data.
