## Notice of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Standardizing the Domain Names Used by Internet Information Services
To implement the requirements of applicable laws, regulations, and rules, including the Counterterrorism Law of the People's Republic of China, the Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China, the Measures for Administration of Internet Information Services, and the Measures for the Administration of Internet Domain Names, and further standardize the domain names used by internet information services, as from January 1, 2018, the domain name used for internet information services shall be registered and owned in accordance with laws, where the registrant of a personal domain name for ICP filing shall be the individual owning the domain name, while that of an organizational domain name shall be the organization (including its shareholders), its main person-in-charge, or its senior officer.
When Tencent Cloud submits your ICP filing information to the competent provincial communications administration bureau for review, the bureau will verify the domain name registration information, and if the verification fails, Tencent Cloud will not be allowed to provide access services to you according to applicable requirements.
In addition, Tencent Cloud will periodically check the status of your domain name and stop providing access services pursuant to this notice if it is found that the domain name does not exist or has expired or false identity information is provided.


## Requirements on domain name for ICP filing
The verification of a domain name for ICP filing can be passed only if all the following conditions are met:
- The top-level domain of the domain name for ICP filing is a state-approved top-level domain (i.e., the domain name suffix can be found via the link below).
[Domain Name Industry Administration Information Publicity System of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology](http://xn--eqrt2g.xn--vuq861b/#)
- The domain name for ICP filing is registered and administrated through a state-approved domain name registrar (domain names registered by a domain registrar outside Mainland China are not eligible for ICP filing application directly and must be transferred to a competent service provider in Mainland China, such as Tencent Cloud).

- The domain name for ICP filing is within the validity period of the domain name registration (subject to the expiry date in the WHOIS information).
- The domain name for ICP filing has passed identity verification.<!--[Tencent Cloud Operation Guide on Domain Name Identity Verification]()-->
- The ICP filing entity information filled in during ICP filing application is the same as the identity information of the domain name registrant.
 - Personal ICP filing: The information of the person-in-charge of ICP filing must be the same as the identity information of the domain name registrant (the information for comparison includes name and identity document type and number).
 - Organizational ICP filing: The name of the ICP filing entity or the information of the person-in-charge of the entity must be the same as the identity information of the domain name registrant (the information for comparison includes name and identity document type and number).

## Only top-level domains require ICP filing

Only top-level domains require ICP filing. Second-level and third-level domains can be used after top-level domain ICP filing approval.

For example, Tencent's top-level domain is `tencent.com`. After obtaining the ICP filing of `tencent.com`, the second-level domain such as `cloud.tencent.com` and third-level domain such as `market.cloud.tencent.com` and `buy.cloud.tencent.com` can be used.
