When the status of an ICP filing application filed through Tencent Cloud changes to "Pending communications administration bureau's approval", the person-in-charge of the application will receive an SMS verification code from the MIIT. The ICP filing application will be processed by the MIIT only after the person-in-charge completes SMS verification.

The pilot provinces for SMS verification include: **Tianjin, Gansu, Tibet, Ningxia, Hainan, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Fujian, Shaanxi, Chongqing, Guangxi, Yunnan, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hunan, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Hubei**. After receiving the SMS verification code, the person-in-charge of ICP filing application should visit the verification platform of the corresponding provincial communications administration bureau and enter the verification code and relevant information to complete the verification. If the verification is not completed within 24 hours, the ICP filing application will be rejected.  <!-- For more information, see [SMS Verification Instructions]() for ICP filing application.()-->
