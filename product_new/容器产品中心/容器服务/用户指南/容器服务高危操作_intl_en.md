When deploying or running business, you may trigger high-risk operations at different levels, leading to service failures to different degrees. To help you estimate and avoid operational risks, this document describes the consequences of the high-risk operations and corresponding solutions. Below you can find the high-risk operations you may trigger when dealing with clusters, networking and load balancing, logs, and cloud disks.
