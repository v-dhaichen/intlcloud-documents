## Operation Scenario
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) can automatically scale the number of pods for services according to the average CPU utilization of target pods and other metrics. This document describes how to implement pod autoscaling using the Tencent Cloud TKE console.

## How Does It Work
The HPA backend component pulls the monitoring metrics of the container and pods from Tencent Cloud’s Cloud Monitor every 30 seconds and then does calculations based on the current metric data, the current number of replicas, and the target value of the metric. The results of this calculation are used as the expected number of replicas for services. When the expected number of replicas is not the same as the current number of replicas, HPA will trigger deployment to adjust the number of pod replicas, thereby achieving auto-scaling.
Taking CPU utilization as an example, if there are currently two pods with an average CPU utilization (the current metric data) of 90%, and the target CPU utilization is set to 60% for autoscaling, the number of pods will be automatically adjusted as follows: 90% × 2 / 60% = 3 pods.
> If you set multiple auto scaling metrics, HPA will separately calculate the target numbers of replicas according to each metric and then take the maximum number to use for auto scaling.

## Considerations
- When the type of metric is selected as **CPU utilization (by request)**, a CPU request must be set up for the container.
- Set a reasonable target for the policy metric. For example, 70% for the container and application, which leaves 30% remaining.
- Keep pods and nodes healthy (avoid frequently recreating pods).
- Ensure that the load balancing you request operate stably.
- The target number of replicas calculated by HPA is allowed to fluctuate within 10%, under which HPA will not adjust the number of replicas.
- If the value of Deployment.spec.replicas corresponding to the service is 0, HPA will not take effect.
- If multiple HPAs are simultaneously bound to a single deployment, then the HPAs created will take effect simultaneously, which will cause clusters to be repeatedly scaled.

##  Prerequisites
- Complete [Tencent Cloud account registration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/register).
- Log in to the [TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2).
- Create a cluster. For details on how to create a cluster, see [Creating a cluster](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/30637).



## Steps

 - **Associate deployment**: This cannot be left blank. To be selected according to your specific requirements.
 - **Trigger policy**: The policy metrics that the auto scaling feature relies on. For details, see [Metric Type](#MetricType).
 - **Pod range**: Select this according to your specific requirements. The number of pods will be auto adjusted within the pre-set range and will not exceed this pre-set range.
4. Click **Create HPA** to complete the process of creating the HPA.

### YAML Creation
1. In the left sidebar, click **[Clusters](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster)** to go to the **Cluster Management** page.
