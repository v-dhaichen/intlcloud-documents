## Introduction
A Service defines the method for accessing a backend Pod and provides a fixed virtual access IP address. You can access the backend Pod through settings in the Service. Services with different access methods can provide different network capabilities.
TKE provides the following 4 access methods:

<table>
<tr>
<th width="15%">Access methods</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Via Internet</td>
<td>
<ul class="params">
<li>In Loadbalance mode of the Service, a public IP address allows direct access to the backend Pod. This is suitable for Web frontend services.</li>
<li>The created service can be accessed outside the cluster by using the <b>CLB domain name or IP address and the Service port</b>; and inside the cluster by using the <b>Service name and Service port</b>.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intra-cluster</td>
<td>
<ul class="params">
<li>Uses the ClusterIP mode of the Service, in which an IP address in the IP address range of the Service is automatically assigned for intra-cluster access. This method is applicable to MySQL and other database services to ensure isolation among service networks.</li>
<li>The created service can be accessed using the <b>Service name and Service port</b>.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Via private network</td>
<td>
<ul class="params">
<li>Uses the Loadbalance mode of the Service. If <code>annotations:service.kubernetes.io/qcloud-loadbalancer-internal-subnetid: subnet-xxxxxxxx</code> is specified, the backend Pod can be accessed using a private IP address.</li>
<li>The created service can be accessed outside the cluster by using the <b>CLB domain name or IP address and the Service port</b>; and inside the cluster by using the <b>Service name and Service port</b>.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Node Port Access</td>
<td>
<ul class="params">
<li>An access method that maps a node port to the container, with support for TCP, UDP, and Ingress. It can be used for forwarding from the upper-layer custom LB to Node.</li>
<li>The created service can be accessed by using <b>CVM IP and Node port</b> or <b>Service name and Service port</b>.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

>Please do not access Service in the cluster via the load balancer IP to avoid access failure.

Usually a layer-4 load balancer (LB) will bind multiple nodes as real servers (RS). In this case, please make sure that the client and RS are not on the same CVM, otherwise the packets will not be able to sent out due to the loopback.
When a Pod accesses an LB, Pod is the source IP. When it is transmitted to the private network, LB will not transfer the source IP to the Node IP via SNAT. Therefore the LB cannot identify the source node of the packet. The LB’s loopback avoidance policy will not take effect, and packet may be forwareded to any RS. When the packet is forwarded to the Node where the client is located, LB will be unable to receive the response, leading to access failure.

## Notes
- Make sure your container and CVM instance do not share a CLB.
- For a CLB managed by TKE, you cannot modify its listeners and backend servers on the CLB Console. Changes made on the CLB Console will be automatically overwritten by TKE.
- When using an existing CLB:
  - You can only use load balancers created through the CLB Console, not balancers automatically created by TKE.
  - Ports of Services sharing the same existing CLB cannot be the same.
  - Services in different clusters cannot share the same CLB.
  - Services sharing the same CLB do not support local access.
  - When you delete a Service using an existing CLB, the real server bound to the balancer needs to be unbound manually. The tag (tke-clusterId: cls-xxxx) is kept for the CLB. You need to clear it manually.

## Managing Service Using kubectl

<span id="YAMLSample"></span>
### YAML sample
```Yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  ## annotations:
  ## service.kubernetes.io/qcloud-loadbalancer-internal-subnetid: subnet-xxxxxxxx ## If you are creating a Service for private network access, you need to specify this annotation.
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 9376
  type: LoadBalancer
```

- kind: identifies the Service resource type.
- metadata: basic information such as Service name and Label.
- metadata.annotations: an additional description of a Service. You can set additional enhancements for TKE through this parameter.
- spec.type: identifies the access type of the Service.
  - ClusterIP: the service is open in the cluster and can be accessed inside the cluster.
  - NodePort: Maps the node port to the backend Service, and the service can be accessed outside the cluster through “[node IP]:[NodePort]”.
  - LoadBalancer: the service is made open to the public through a CLB. A public network CLB is created by default if you choose this type. You can also create a private network CLB by specifying the annotations.
  - ExternalName: the Service is mapped to DNS. This is only applicable to kube-dns v1.7 or higher.

#### annotations: create a Service for public/private network access with an existing load balancer

If the existing application CLB is idle and you want to use it for a Service created by TKE, or you want to use the same CLB within the cluster, you can set it using the following annotations:
>Read the [Notes](#annotations) before using it.
>
```Yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    service.kubernetes.io/tke-existed-lbid: lb-6swtxxxx
```

#### annotations: specifies the Loadbalancer bound to the node

If your cluster is large, you need to set affinity scheduling for entry-type applications to schedule them to certain nodes. You can configure the Loadbalancer of the Service to bind the Loadbalancer only to specified nodes. The annotations are as follows:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    service.kubernetes.io/qcloud-loadbalancer-backends-label: `key in (value1, value2) ` ## LabelSelector format
```

- It is recommended to use this together with workload affinity scheduling.
- The prerequisite is that a Label has been set for the nodes according to your business needs.
- Use native LabelSelector formats such as:
  - service.kubernetes.io/qcloud-loadbalancer-backends-label: key1=values1, key2=values2
  - service.kubernetes.io/qcloud-loadbalancer-backends-label: key1 in (value1),key2 in (value2)
  - service.kubernetes.io/qcloud-loadbalancer-backends-label: key in (value1, value2)
  - service.kubernetes.io/qcloud-loadbalancer-backends-label: key1, key2 notin (value2)
- If a new node is matched, it will be automatically bound to the Loadbalancer.
- If you modify the label of an existing node, the node will be dynamically bound with or unbound from the Loadbalancer in accordance with the matching rule.

#### Descriptions
If you are using an account with **IP bandwidth packages**, you need to specify the following two annotations when creating a service accessible to the public network:
- `service.kubernetes.io/qcloud-loadbalancer-internet-charge-type` identifies the public network bandwidth billing method. Optional values include:   
 -  TRAFFIC_POSTPAID_BY_HOUR (Bill-by-traffic)
 -  BANDWIDTH_POSTPAID_BY_HOUR (Bill-by-bandwidth)
- `service.kubernetes.io/qcloud-loadbalancer-internet-max-bandwidth-out` identifies the bandwidth cap (value range: [1,2000] Mbps).
   For example:
```Yaml
  metadata:
  annotations:
  service.kubernetes.io/qcloud-loadbalancer-internet-charge-type: TRAFFIC_POSTPAID_BY_HOUR
  service.kubernetes.io/qcloud-loadbalancer-internet-max-bandwidth-out: "10"
```
For more information on **IP bandwidth packages**, see the [Bandwidth Package Types](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/684/15246) document.

### Creating a Service

1. Prepare the StatefulSet YAML file as instructed by [YAML sample](#YAMLSample).
2. Install kubectl and connect to a cluster. For detailed operations, see [Connecting to Clusters](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/31086).
3. Run the following command to create the Service YAML file.
```shell
kubectl create -f Service YAML filename
```
For example, if you want to create a Service YAML file named “my-service.yaml”, run the following command:
 ```shell
kubectl create -f my-service.yaml
 ```
4. Run the following command to check whether the Service YAML file was successfully created:
```shell
kubectl get services
```
A message similar to the one below indicates that the Ingress YAML file is successfully created.
```
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes ClusterIP 172.16.255.1 <none> 443/TCP 38d
```

### Updating a Service

#### Method 1
Run the following command to update a Service:
```
kubectl edit service/[name]
```

#### Method 2
1. Manually delete the old Service.
2. Run the following command to create a new Service:
```
kubectl create/apply
```

### Deleting a Service
Run the following command to delete a Service:
```
kubectl delete service [NAME]
```
