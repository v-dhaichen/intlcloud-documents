## Introduction
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) can automatically scale the number of Pods for services according to the average CPU utilization of target Pods and other metrics. This document describes how to implement Pod autoscaling via Tencent Cloud TKE console.

## How It Works
The HPA backend components pull monitoring metrics of containers and Pods from Tencent Cloud’s Cloud Monitor every 30 seconds and calculate the desired number of replicas based on the current monitoring data, the current number of replicas, and the desired value of the metrics. When there is a gap between the desired number and the actual number of replicas, HPA will trigger a Deployment to adjust the number of Pod replicas, thereby achieving auto-scaling.
Take CPU utilization as an example. Suppose there are two Pods with an average CPU utilization of 90%, and the target CPU utilization is set to 60% for autoscaling. Then the number of Pods will be automatically adjusted as follows: 90% × 2 / 60% = 3 Pods.
> If you set multiple auto scaling metrics, HPA will calculate the target numbers of replicas separately according to each metric and then use the maximum number for auto scaling.

## Notes
- If you choose **CPU utilization (by request)** as the metric type, a CPU request must be set for the container.
- Set reasonable targets for the policy metrics. For example, set 70% for containers and applications and leave 30%.
- Keep Pods and nodes healthy; avoid frequently recreating Pods.
- Ensure that the load balancer works stably.
- If the gap between the actual number and desired number of replicas is smaller than 10%, HPA will not adjust the number of replicas.
- If the value of Deployment.spec.replicas corresponding to the service is 0, HPA will not work.
- If multiple HPAs are bound to a single Deployment, the HPAs will take effect simultaneously, which will cause clusters to be repeatedly scaled.

## Prerequisites
- You have [registered for a Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/register).
- You are logged in to the [TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2).
- You have created a cluster. For details about how to create a cluster, see [Creating a Cluster](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/30637).



## Directions

### Enabling Auto Scaling
You can enable auto scaling in one of the following ways.

### Setting auto-adjustment of the number of Pods
1. In the left sidebar, click **[Clusters](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster)** to go to the **Cluster Management** page.
2. Click the ID of the cluster for which you want to create the scaling group to go to the Deployment page. Select **Create** as shown below:

 - **Trigger Policy**: the policy metrics that trigger the auto-scaling. For details, see [Metric Type](#MetricType).
 - **Number of Pods**: enter the minimum and maximum numbers according to your needs. The number of Pods will be auto-adjusted within the range.
