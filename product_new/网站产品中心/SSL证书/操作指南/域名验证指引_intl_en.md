## Scenario

This document tells you how to verify your ownership of a domain name after DV certificate application.
> Please complete the verification as soon as possible. CA will reject your certificate application if you fail to do so within 3 days or if the verification is not successful.

The domain name ownership can be verified by:
- [Manual DNS verification](#ManualVerification)
- [File verification](#FileVerification)

## Prerequisites

- For [manual DNS verification](#ManualVerification), you need to complete the application for a DV certificate first.
- For [file verification](#FileVerification), you need to obtain the username and password for logging in to the server.

## Directions

<span id="CertificateDetails"></span>

#### Viewing Certificate Details

1. Log in to the [SSL Certificate Service Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ssl).
2. On the "Certificate List" page, select the ID of the DV certificate to be viewed to enter the "Certificate Details" page, as shown below:
![Certificate details](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/7d5076fc1e24794fac42a2bea15a2540.jpg)
3. View the certificate status in the basic information section on the "Certificate Details" page.
You can verify the domain name ownership by resolving the specified DNS record. The resolution format can be specified as "**Host name > TXT record type > record value**".
For example, add a TXT record to the domain name `www.domain.com` for certificate application with the specified resolution format of "`www.domain.com` > TXT > 20181227220956......hj37i4xai8m7uii2a23l".
### Automatic DNS Verification

> This DNS verification method is limited to domain names resolved by Tencent Cloud DNS.

If the domain name for which you are applying for a certificate has been resolved by Tencent Cloud DNS, you can choose automatic verification.
The system automatically adds the specified DNS record for the domain name. If the record is found matching the specified value, it is automatically cleared when the domain name ownership verification is completed.

### File Verification

#### Creating a File in the Specified Directory

1. Log in to the server.
2. Create the specified file in the root directory of the website, including the file directory, name, and content.
 >The website root directory refers to the folder where you store the website programs on the server. Its name may be wwwroot, htdocs, public_html, or webroot.

For example, create a file as shown in the table below:
<table>
<tr><th>File Directory</th><th>Filename</th><th>File Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>/.well-known/pki-validation</td><td>fileauth.txt</td><td>201808241742072yvt8bxp9jv0ycginrnnebwgy1nvwgvxtssucy39w7b20nelfa</td></tr>
</table>
3. Open a browser and access the corresponding URL based on the type of the domain name to be verified.
**URL format**: `http://domainname/filedirectory/filename` or `https://domainame/filedirectory/filename`.
Access the URL to get the content of the file, such as `201608241742072yvt8bxp9jv0ycginrnnebwgy1nvwgvxtssucy39w7b20nelfa`.
 - If the domain name for which you are applying for file verification is `example.www.domain.com`, access the URL `http://example.www.domain.com/.well-known/pki-validation/fileauth.txt` or `https://example.www.domain.com/.well-known/pki-validation/fileauth.txt` for verification.
 >For a second-level domain name beginning with www such as `www.domain.com`, add [file verification](#FileVerification) to the domain name first and then add the file to its primary domain name `domain.com` for [file verification](#FileVerification) as instructed in the **URL format** section, and the verification value is displayed as the same.
 - If the domain name for which you are applying for file verification is a wildcard domain name - `*.domain.com`, access the URL `http://domain.com/.well-known/pki-validation/fileauth.txt` or `https://domain.com/.well-known/pki-validation/fileauth.txt` for verification.
>
> - Both HTTP and HTTPS are supported, and either of them can be accessed.
> - File verification does not support any redirect, and direct response to status code 200 and file content is needed.

#### Waiting for Review

Please wait patiently for scan and review by the CA. For example, a **DV certificate** is generally issued in 10 minutes - 24 hours. Once the certificate is issued, the file and directory can be deleted.

#### Note

On Windows, you need to create a file and folder that begin with a dot by running the command line.
For example, to create a `.well-known` folder, run the following command in the command line window.
```
mkdir .well-known
```
