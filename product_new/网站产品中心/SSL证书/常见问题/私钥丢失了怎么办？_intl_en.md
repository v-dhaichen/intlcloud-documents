### What should I do if I lost my private key?
Scenario 1. If your certificate is a paid one and you selected **Generate CSR Online** when purchasing/renewing it, or your certificate is a free one, please follow the steps below in case of private key loss:
1. Log in to the [SSL Certificate Service Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ssl).
2. Select the certificate for which you want to get the private key, click **Download** in the "Operation" column, and decompress the zipped package to get the corresponding private key.

Scenario 2. If your certificate is a paid one and you selected **Paste CSR** when purchasing/renewing it, the private key was generated externally and you cannot get it directly. In this case, you can reissue the certificate and select **Generate CSR Online** to generate a new certificate and private key as shown below:
1. Log in to the [SSL Certificate Service Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ssl).
2. Select the certificate for which you want to get the private key and click **Operation** > **More** > **Reissue**.
3. Select **Generate CSR Online**, confirm the information, and submit it to get a new certificate and private key.
