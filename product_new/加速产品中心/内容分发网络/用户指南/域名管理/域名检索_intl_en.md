>CDN cannot make global searches if no attribute is entered. Therefore, the **domain name** attribute is added for search by default. In other words, when you enter a single keyword, the content in the search box will be `domain name:www.test.com`; when you copy characters, the content in the search box will be `domain name:test|abc`.
