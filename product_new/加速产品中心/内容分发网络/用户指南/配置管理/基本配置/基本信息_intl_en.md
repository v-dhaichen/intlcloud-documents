You can view the basic information of a domain name in the CDN Console, including its accelerated domain name, CNAME, creation time, project, and service type. You can also modify the **project** and **service type** as needed.

> Changing the service type will also change the acceleration platform and optimization model. Please make sure that the modification matches your service type. If you are a Tencent Cloud VIP customer and have issues changing the service type manually, you can contact our pre-sales or after-sales customer service or submit a ticket.
