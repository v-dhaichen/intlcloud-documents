## Unique IP access requests
The number of unique IP access requests in the specified time period is calculated by deduplicating access client IPs in the log:
- If the time range is less than or equal to one day, a deduplicated IP curve with a 5-minute granularity will be provided.
- Domain name statistics are counted by deduplicating the active quantity in a full day. If there are multiple domain names, projects or accounts, the statistics are counted by accumulating the daily active quantity of each one with a 5-minute granularity.

## User access district distribution
The district of the access requester can be identified via the source client IP, which can be displayed in a map or list, allowing you to view the district distribution of your users.

## User ISP distribution
The ISP of the access requester can be identified via the source client IP, which can be displayed in a pie chart or list, allowing you to view the ISP distribution of your users.
