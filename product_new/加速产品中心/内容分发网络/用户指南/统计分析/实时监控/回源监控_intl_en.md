## Metrics Descriptions
### Metrics on the overview page
Log in to the [CDN Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdn) and select **Statistics** > **Realtime Monitoring** on the left sidebar to enter the management page. The **Access Monitoring** tab is displayed by default. You can click **Origin-Pull Monitoring** on the right to enter the origin-pull monitoring metrics page. The monitoring curves of all domain names with a 1-minute granularity in the last 6 hours will be returned, including the following metrics:
+ Origin-pull bandwidth: Calculated by dividing the total origin-pull traffic in one minute by 60 seconds.
+ Origin-pull traffic: Total origin-pull traffic in the cache node at the last layer.
+ Origin-pull requests: Total number of origin-pull requests in the cache node at the last layer.
+ Origin-pull failure rate: Percentage of failing origin-pull requests out of all origin-pull requests.
+ Percentage of origin-pull status code: Percentage chart of status codes (2XX/3XX/4XX/5XX) returned for origin-pull requests within the selected time period.
+ 2XX origin-pull status codes: Status codes generated by 2XX origin-pull status code monitoring will be counted.
+ 3XX origin-pull status codes: Status codes generated by 3XX origin-pull status code monitoring will be counted.
+ 4XX origin-pull status codes: Status codes generated by 4XX origin-pull status code monitoring will be counted.
+ 5XX origin-pull status codes: Status codes generated by 5XX origin-pull status code monitoring will be counted.

**The following conditions will be counted as failing origin-pull requests:**
+ Timeout in receiving origin-pull data.
+ Timeout in sending origin-pull request.
+ Timeout in establishing a TCP connection for origin-pull.
+ The origin server actively closes the connection.
+ HTTP protocol compatibility error of the origin server.

## Granularity Description
### Granularity on the overview page
The monitoring page provides options to display data curves at a 1-minute, 5-minute, 1-hour, or 1-day granularity. The minimum time granularity can be displayed varies by the selected time period.
+ Time period ≤ 6 hours: The minimum time granularity is 1 minute. The latency for displaying the 1-minute curve is about 3 minutes.
+ 6 hours < time period ≤ 24 hours: The minimum time granularity is 5 minutes. The latency for displaying 5-minute curve is about 5–10 minutes.
+ 24 hours < time period ≤ 31 days: The minimum time granularity is 1 hour.
+ Time period > 31 days: The minimum time granularity is 1 day.


### Granularity on the details page
The time granularity options on the metric details page are as follows:
+ Time period ≤ 24 hours: The minimum time granularity is 1 minute. The latency for displaying the 1-minute curve is about 3 minutes.
+ 24 hours < time period ≤ 31 days: The minimum time granularity can be 5 minutes, 1 hour, or 1 day.
+ Time period > 31 days: The minimum time granularity is 1 day.

>
>- The data collected at a 1-minute granularity can be queried only in the new version of the console. For historical data, the minimum granularity for query is 5 minutes.
>- The maximum time period for query is 90 days.

### Aggregation Description
The method for aggregating 1-minute data into 5-minute, 1-hour, or 1-day data varies by data metric.
+ Origin-pull bandwidth: The smallest granularity provided by CDN for monitoring bandwidth data is 1 minute. Based on industry standard, fees are generally billed by 5-minute granularity, which is calculated by taking the average of 1-minute data values. Therefore, the bandwidth data at a 1-hour or 1-day granularity can be calculated based on the maximum 5-minute bandwidth value.
+ Origin-pull traffic: The traffic data at a 5-minute, 1-hour, or 1-day granularity is obtained by aggregating 1-minute traffic data.
+ Origin-pull requests: The request count at a 5-minute, 1-hour, or 1-day granularity is obtained by aggregating 1-minute request counts.
+ Origin-pull failure rate: Calculated by dividing the total number of origin-pull failures by the total number of origin-pull requests based on the selected time granularity.
+ Origin-pull status codes: The status code data at a 5-minute, 1-hour, or 1-day granularity is obtained by aggregating 1-minute status code data.
