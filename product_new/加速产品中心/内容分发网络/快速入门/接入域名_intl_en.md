Currently, wildcard domain names  can also be added, but verification is required. You can upload verification files provided by Tencent Cloud to the root directory of the website, complete verification, and then add wildcard domain names. Pay attention to the following restrictions:
<li>If a wildcard domain name such as *. test.com has already been connected to Tencent Cloud, its sub-domain names cannot be connected to another account. </li>
<li>If the wildcard domain name .test.com has already been connected to your account, wildcard domain names in formats such as .path.test.com cannot be connected to this account.</li>

The IP address and domain name of the origin server should meet the following conditions:<br>
<li> If a domain name is entered, it **cannot** be the same as the access domain name (i.e., the connected accelerated domain name). The "DOMAIN NAME:PORT" format is supported, and the port number should be **between 0 and 65535 (inclusive)**.
<li>You can enter multiple IP addresses in the format of "IP:PORT", and the port number should be **between 0 and 65535 (inclusive)**. Origin-pull requests will access the IP addresses in turn.
<li>When there are multiple IP addresses, weight can be configured in the format of IP:PORT:WEIGHT, where PORT can be omitted. In this case, the format is IP::WEIGHT, where WEIGHT ranges from 0 to 100 (for IPv4 addresses only).
<li>The entered IP address cannot be an intranet address. </td>

<li> If the origin server type is COS, you can enter or select the bucket domain name from the drop-down list.
<li> If there is no bucket, you need to log into the <a href ="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5">COS Console</a> to create one (for instructions, please see <a href = "https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13309">Creating Buckets</a>).

## Configuring the acceleration service

Select the acceleration service type and basic configuration.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/c2f355d4b1ec5b5b50efb4b56e5b5d6f.png)
1. **Business Type** 
   The business type determines the resource platform to be scheduled by the domain name. The acceleration configuration varies by resource platform. Please select a business type based on your business conditions:
	- Static acceleration: Suitable for static resource acceleration scenarios such as ecommerce, websites, and gaming images.
	- Download acceleration: Suitable for scenarios such as game installations, audio/video downloads, and mobile phone firmware package distribution.
	- Streaming VOD acceleration: Suitable for VOD acceleration scenarios.
2. **Basic Configuration**
   CDN provides the Ignore Query String switch, which allows you to control whether to filter parameters after **"?"** in end users' request URLs. You can use this feature for flexible version control or token-based authentication. For more information, please see [Ignore query string configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/228/6291).
3. **Cache expiration configuration**
   Cache expiration configuration refers to a set of expiration rules that CDN cache nodes should comply with when caching your business content. For more information, please see [Cache Expiration Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/228/6290).

## Completing the connection

Click **Submit** to add the domain name and wait for the domain name configuration to be delivered over the entire network. This usually takes 5 to 10 minutes.

>After the connection is successful, CDN will assign you a corresponding CNAME address. CDN service takes effect only after you complete the CNAME configuration. For more information, please see [Configuring CNAME](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/3121).
