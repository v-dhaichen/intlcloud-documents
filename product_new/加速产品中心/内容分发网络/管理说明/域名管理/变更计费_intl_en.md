- If you are a Tencent Cloud VIP customer, you can contact your Tencent Cloud sales rep for assistance in changing your billing mode.

The billing mode can be changed as described in [Billing Instruction](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/2949#.E8.AE.A1.E8.B4.B9.E6.A8.A1.E5.BC.8F.E9.80.89.E6.8B.A9).

## Notes
The billing mode used to calculate the generated consumption on the current day will be also used for settlement on the following day.
+ When users switch from Bill-by-Bandwidth to Bill-by-Traffic on the day itself, if consumption has yet to occur, they will be charged with Bill-by-Traffic on the following day unless they switch the billing method again;
+ If consumption has already occurred that day, users will still be charged with Bill-by-Bandwidth the following day. Bill-by-Traffic will apply from the second day on, postpaid on the third day going forward, unless they switch the billing method again.

## How to Change
1. Log in to the [CDN Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdn) and click **Overview** on the left sidebar to enter the management page and click **Change** in the top-right corner.
