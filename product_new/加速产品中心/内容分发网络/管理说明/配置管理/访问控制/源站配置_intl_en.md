You can modify the configuration of the origin server for your domain name:
- Multi-site active-active IPs 
When multiple IPs are configured as the origin server, CDN uses a polling policy to randomly select an IP for origin-pull. It also performs origin server detection, so that when an origin server IP is found to be exceptional, it will be blocked for a period of time (60 seconds by default) and skipped during polling.
- Domain name origin server
A specified domain name can be set as the origin server, which should be different from the accelerated domain name.
- COS bucket origin server
A public domain name of the selected COS bucket can be used as an origin server for CDN origin-pull.
- Slave origin server configuration
Tencent Cloud CDN supports configuring an external domain name as a hot backup slave origin server. When an origin-pull request to the master origin server fails (e.g., 4XX, 5XX, or TCP connection errors), it will be forwarded to the slave origin server. Configuring a slave origin server can effectively reduce origin-pull failure rate and improve the service quality. Hot backup slave origin server does not support HTTPS origin-pull for the time being; therefore, when you configure a certificate for a domain name with a slave origin server, do not select HTTPS origin-pull.
>- Only origin servers of the domain names connected by you can be modified. CDN accelerated domain names automatically created by [COS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/cos) buckets cannot be modified.
>- According to applicable regulations, if an origin server uses a Tencent Cloud CVMæŠ¯ accelerated domain name, the domain name configured to be the host header should have completed ICP filing through Tencent Cloud.

## Configuration Guide
### Viewing the Configuration
1. Log in to the [CDN Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdn) and click **Domain Management** on the left sidebar to enter the management page.
2. Find the domain name you want to edit and click **Manage** in the operation column.

3. You will see the **Origin Server Information** module on the **Basic Configuration** Page. You can view the current origin server configuration of the domain name here.

## Modifying Origin Server
1. Go to **Basic Configuration** to see the **Origin Server Information** module.

2. Click the **Edit** icon in the top-right corner of the master origin server to modify its type:

**External Origin**: The origin server address can be configured as multiple IPs or one single domain name. Origin-pull to the specified port is supported in the format of "domain name:PORT/IP:PORT" in the value range from 0 to 65535.
- If the origin server address is configured as IPs, the weight of the origin server IPs can be configured in the format of IP:PORT:WEIGHT in the value range from 0 to 1000.
	- The weight cannot be set for single origin server.
	- If the origin server is multiple IPs, it is not allowed to set origin-pull weight only for certain IPs.
	- If the origin server is in domain name format, the weight cannot be set. Only IP origin servers support weight configuration.
	- Weight can be configured in the format of IP:PORT:WEIGHT, where PORT can be omitted. In this case, the format is IP::WEIGHT.
	- Currently, only IPv4 addresses support weight configuration, while IPv6 addresses do not.

**COS Origin**: Specify a COS bucket as the origin server.


### Adding a Slave Origin Server
1. If the origin server of a domain name is an **external origin**, you can add a hot backup slave origin server for it. When an origin-pull request to the master origin server fails (e.g., 4XX, 5XX, or TCP connection errors), it will be forwarded to the slave origin server.

2. A slave origin server can only be added for an external origin. The origin server address can be configured as multiple IPs or one domain name. Origin-pull to the specified port is supported in the port range from 0 to 65535.

### Modifying Slave Origin Server
Once a slave origin server is added, master/slave switch can be easily performed in the console. You can also modify or delete the slave origin server.

## Sample Case
A user requests `http://www.test.com/1.jpg` which is not hit on any node. The request is forwarded to the origin server.
1. If the origin server is configured as follows:
 ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/cacaa282099503853d960bcd69482351.jpg)
If the resource is not cached on the server `1.1.1.1`, a 404 error will be directly returned. In this case, after receiving the response, the CDN node at the origin-pull layer will directly return the request to the requesting client, and the client cannot obtain the image.
2. If the origin server is configured as follows:
 ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/08756e81a68f7e04f079289c95d33cd1.jpg)
If the resource is not cached on the server `1.1.1.1`, a 404 error will be directly returned. In this case, after receiving the response, the CDN node at the origin-pull layer will request the resource again to the slave origin server `2.2.2.2`. If `2.2.2.2` returns a 200 status code, the node will send the successfully obtained content to the requesting client, and the client will successfully obtain the image.
