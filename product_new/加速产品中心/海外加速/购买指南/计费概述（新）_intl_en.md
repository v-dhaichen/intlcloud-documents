>   
> - Each CDN node collects traffic data in real time and reports it to the billing center which aggregates the data entries into total traffic data. For bill-by-bandwidth, bandwidth value = 5-minute total traffic / 300s. For example, if the total traffic generated in 5 minutes is 30 MB, the corresponding bandwidth will be <nobr>(30 * 8) / 300 = 0.8 Mbps</nobr> (1 MB = 8 Mbps).
> - Base conversion: 1 GB = 1,000 MB; 1 MB = 1,000 KB; 1 Gbps = 1,000 Mbps; 1 Mbps = 1,000 Kbps.

### Bill-by-bandwidth
#### Tiered pricing
GCD adopts a region-specific **tiered pricing** based on **daily peak bandwidth**. The pricing tiers are as shown below:

| Bandwidth Tier <br/> (USD/Mbps/day) | North America (NA) | Europe (EU) | Asia Pacific Zone 1 (AP1) | Asia Pacific Zone 2 (AP2) | Asia Pacific Zone 3 (AP3) | Middle East (ME) | Africa (AA) | South America (SA) |
|----------------------------------|-----------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------|--|--|
| 0–500 Mbps (inclusive) | 0.2941    | 0.2941 | 0.4412 | 0.5882 | 0.6471        | 0.8529    | 0.6471    | 0.6471    |
| 500 Mbps–5 Gbps (inclusive) | 0.2471    | 0.2471    | 0.3882        | 0.5294        | 0.5941        | 0.7824    | 0.5941    | 0.5941    |
| 5–50 Gbps (inclusive) | 0.1824    | 0.1824    | 0.3412        | 0.4706        | 0.5471        | 0.7059    | 0.5471    | 0.5471    |
| > 50 Gbps | 0.1294    | 0.1294    | 0.2941        | 0.4118        | 0.5           | 0.6176    | 0.5       | 0.5       |

#### Calculation method
Assuming that the peak bandwidth of GCD in the **North America billing region** is X, the calculation method for tiered pricing is as follows:
1. If X ≤ 500 Mbps, the bill amount will be X \* 0.2941.
2. If 500 Mbps < X ≤ 5,000 Mbps, the bill amount will be X \* 0.2471.
3. If 5,000 Mbps < X ≤ 50,000 Mbps, the bill amount will be X \* 0.1824.
4. If X > 50,000 Mbps, the bill amount will be X \* 0.1294.

GCD service fees in other regions are charged based on their respective unit price and usage.

### Bill-by-traffic	
#### Tiered pricing
GCD offers a region-specific **bill-by-traffic** with **monthly cumulative tier**. The billing tiers are as shown below:

| Traffic Tier <br/> (USD/GB) | North America (NA) | Europe (EU) | Asia Pacific Zone 1 (AP1) | Asia Pacific Zone 2 (AP2) | Asia Pacific Zone 3 (AP3) | Middle East (ME) | Africa (AA) | South America (SA) |
|---------------------------|---------------|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 0–2 TB (inclusive) | 0.0547    | 0.0547    | 0.0812        | 0.1094        | 0.12          | 0.1588    | 0.12      | 0.12      |
| 2–10 TB (inclusive) | 0.0459    | 0.0459    | 0.0724        | 0.1024        | 0.1129        | 0.1465    | 0.1129    | 0.1129    |
| 10–50 TB (inclusive) | 0.0388    | 0.0388    | 0.0653        | 0.0935        | 0.1059        | 0.1359    | 0.1059    | 0.1059    |
| 50–100 TB (inclusive) | 0.0318    | 0.0318    | 0.0582        | 0.0847        | 0.0988        | 0.1253    | 0.0988    | 0.0988    |
| > 100 TB | 0.0247    | 0.0247    | 0.0547        | 0.0759        | 0.0918        | 0.1147    | 0.0918    | 0.0918    |

#### Calculation method
Unlike bill-by-bandwidth, bill-by-traffic is based on a monthly cumulative tier. Here is an example describing how to calculate the fees:
+ Suppose the traffic generated in the **North America billing zone** on January 1 is 3 TB, as shown in the figure below. The gray zone represents the actual billing tier and the green zone shows the traffic generated on January 1. As 2 TB falls into the 0–2 TB billing tier and the remaining 1 TB falls into the 2–10 TB tier, the actual fees for January 1 will be 2 \* 1000 \* 0.0547 + 1 \* 1000 \* 0.0459.
  ![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/bfdae242f6cca57421a65e46a96b0c67/image.png)
+ Suppose the traffic generated on January 2 is also 3 TB, as shown in the figure below. As bill-by-traffic is based on monthly cumulative traffic, all 3 TB falls into the 2–10 TB tier, so the actual fees for January 2 will be 3 \* 1000 \* 0.0459.
  ![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/f62d1056c1c2cab249cec62ad6e74ddc/image.png)
+ Suppose the traffic generated on January 3 is 7 TB, as shown in the figure below.  Of this 7 TB, 4 TB falls into the 2–10 TB tier and the remaining 3 TB falls into the 10–50 TB tier, so the actual fees for January 3 will be 4 \* 1000 \* 0.0459 + 3 \* 1000 \* 0.0388.
  ![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/954e2d483e31afd411f9a91ebd7f66c8/image.png)

The fees incurred each day in January can be calculated accordingly with the above described method. Fees for each region should be calculated separately. A new billing cycle will begin on February 1.

<span ID ="m3"></span>

### Billed by monthly average of daily bandwidth values
1. Suppose a customer's billing officially started on February 1, 2017 and the contracted price for the specified zone is P USD/Mbps/month.
2. A valid day refers to a day when more than 0 Kbps of bandwidth is consumed.
3. Assuming there are 14 days in February with over 0 Kbps bandwidth, we take the maximum value of the 288 statistical points for each of those 14 days as Max_1, Max_2, Max_3..., and Max_14, respectively. The billable bandwidth will be Average(Max_1, Max_2, ..., Max_14), and so the February fee is: Average(Max_1, Max_2, ..., Max_14)  \*  P  \*  14 / 28.


### Billed by monthly 95th percentile bandwidth	
1. Suppose a customer's billing officially started on February 1, 2017 and the contracted price for the specified zone is P USD/Mbps/month.
2. A valid day refers to a day when more than 0 Kbps of bandwidth is consumed.
3. Assuming there are 14 days in February with over 0 Kbps bandwidth, 14 days has 14 \* 288 statistical points, and the highest 5% points are removed. The highest remaining point is the Max95, which is the billable bandwidth. So the February fee is: Max95 \* P \* 14 / 28.

## Choosing a Billing Plan
**Options:**
GCD offers two billing plans: **bill-by-traffic** and **bill-by-bandwidth**. You can select an appropriate one based on your business needs. The chosen plan will apply to all of your GCD billing regions.

+ If your bandwidth utilization exceeds 50%, your business is relatively stable. We recommend bill-by-bandwidth.
+ IIf your bandwidth utilization is below 50%, your business tends towards fluctuations. We recommend bill-by-traffic.

**Calculation example:**
You can choose a suitable billing plan by calculating bandwidth utilization. Below is an example of how to do so.
Suppose the traffic consumed by your business between 00:00 and 24:00 yesterday was 200 GB. The graph below shows the traffic curve, and the consumed traffic is the area occupied by the curve.
![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/3ecfe86a031782ebeaf0b1f7595cc69f/image.png)
Suppose that your bandwidth peak between 00:00 and 24:00 yesterday was 40 Mbps. Given the formula traffic = bandwidth * time and the fact that there are 86,400 seconds per day, we can calculate 40 Mbps * 86,400s = 3,456,000 Mbps. As 8 Mbps = 1 MB and 1,000 MB = 1 GB, the traffic for one day will be 3,456,000 Mbps = 3456000 / 8 / 1000 = 432 GB, which can be seen as the area occupied by the rectangle in the graph:
![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/b80d043b6e7f461d62fd2d87abf67005/image.png)
Therefore, the bandwidth utilization is 200 GB / 432 GB \* 100% = 46%. This is below 50%, so we recommend bill-by-traffic.

## Arrears
### Verified users
If you have completed individual/organizational identity verification before activating the GCD service, you will receive a notification via SMS and email when your Tencent Cloud account falls into arrears. A **24-hour** grace period will be provided. If you fail to top up your account within 24 hours, your GCD acceleration service will be suspended. You need to manually restart the acceleration service in the console when your account regains a positive balance.
>When your acceleration service is suspended due to arrears, all your domain names will be deactivated and all access requests will be forwarded to the origin server. You can query information but cannot modify configurations in the CDN Console. Your GCD-related domain names and configurations will be retained for 12 months.
