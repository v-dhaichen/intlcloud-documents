## Use Cases
- **One-to-one chat on the app**
One-to-one messages are applicable to one-to-one chats on the app.
- **App admin sends messages**
One-to-one messages can be sent by the app admin from the backend, or by the app admin simulating other users.
- **App admin simulates system messages**
The app admin can simulate system messages by sending messages from the backend. These messages deliver notifications to users as system messages, and app admin custom messages received by the app will be specially handled.

Instant Messaging (IM) provides comprehensive one-to-one messaging capabilities. At the same time, the permission control and extension capabilities of one-to-one messaging provide features such as message history, multi-device synchronization, offline message push, and carrying sender profiles in messages.

## Processing of Offline One-to-One Chat Messages
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/d28999fa32da4e5e6750f34117e116bb.png)

#### Offline and roaming processing of one-to-one chat messages:

1. User A calls `sendMessage` to send messages to user B who is offline.
  - User A is added to user Bâ€™s recent contacts, with up to 100 messages cached.
  - Messages are stored in the offline cache for 7 days, and the maximum cache capacity is 30 KB.
  - Messages are stored on the roaming server for 7 days.
2. User B calls the `login` API to log in to IM.
3. The SDK automatically pulls messages from the offline cache and throws them through the `OnNewMessage` API.
4. The SDK automatically pulls recent contacts and throws them through the `OnNewMessage` API.
5. The user is notified through the `OnRefresh` API when message synchronization is completed.
6. The user calls `getMessage`. If local messages are incomplete, the SDK automatically pulls them from the roaming server.
