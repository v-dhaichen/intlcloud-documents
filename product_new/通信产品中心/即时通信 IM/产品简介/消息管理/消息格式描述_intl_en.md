## Description of MsgBody Message Content
Message content is entered in the fields of MsgBody. Instant Messaging (IM) supports multiple message elements in one message, for example, a message can contain both text and emojis. Therefore, MsgBody is defined as an array that can include as many message elements as needed. The name for a message element is TIMMsgElement.  <!--For examples of TIMMsgElements constituting MsgBody, see [MsgBody Message Content Examples]().-->

The format of TIMMsgElement is defined as follows:
```
{
    "MsgType": "",
    "MsgContent": {}
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| MsgType | String | The type of the message element. Currently, these message objects are supported: TIMTextElem (text message), TIMLocationElem (location message), TIMFaceElem (emoji message), TIMCustomElem (custom message), TIMSoundElem (audio message), TIMImageElem (image message), TIMFileElem (file message), and TIMVideoFileElem (video message). |
| MsgContent | Object | The content of the message element. Each MsgType has its own MsgContent format. For more information, see below. |

The following table lists the message types (MsgType) that are currently supported:

| Value of MsgType | Type |
|---------|---------|
| TIMTextElem | Text |
| TIMLocationElem | Geographic location |
| TIMFaceElem | Emoji |
| TIMCustomElem | Custom. When the receiver is an iOS device and the app is working in the background, this type of messages provide fields other than text to APNs. A combined message can contain only one TIMCustomElem custom message element. |
| TIMSoundElem | Audio. Server-side integrated RESTful APIs cannot send this type of messages. |
| TIMImageElem | Image. Server-side integrated RESTful APIs cannot send this type of messages. |
| TIMFileElem | File. Server-side integrated RESTful APIs cannot send this type of messages. |
| TIMVideoFileElem | Video. Server-side integrated RESTful APIs cannot send this type of messages. |

>Only TIMTextElem, TIMLocationElem, TIMFaceElem, and TIMCustomElem messages can be sent through RESTful APIs integrated with the server. Other types of messages including TIMSoundElem, TIMImageElem, TIMFileElem, and TIMVideoFileElem messages cannot be sent through RESTful APIs.

## Message Element TIMMsgElement

### Text message element

```
{
    "MsgType": "TIMTextElem",
    "MsgContent": {
        "Text": "hello world"
    }
}
```

    }
}
```
| Field | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Data | String | Custom message data. This field is not delivered as a payload field by APNs, and therefore the data field cannot be obtained in payload. |
| Desc | String | Custom message description. When the receiver is an iOS or Android device and the app is working in the background, it is displayed as offline push text. |
| Ext | String | The extended field. When the receiver is an iOS or Android device and the app is working in the background, this field is delivered as an Ext key value in APNs request packet payloads. The protocol format of Ext is defined by the business end, the APNs is only responsible for passthrough. |
| Sound | String | Custom APNs push ringtone |

When the receiver is an iOS or Android device and the app is working in the background, the `Desc` field is delivered as push text, the `Ext` field is delivered as an `Ext` key value in APNs request packet payloads, and the `Data` field is not delivered as a payload field by APNs. Note that a combined message can contain only one TIMCustomElem custom message element.

## Description of Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)
### Push notification display format on the client
- **Account nickname is not set**
If an account has not set a nickname, APNs only displays text content. For one-to-one chat messages, **push text** is displayed. For group messages, **(group name): push text** is displayed.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/7bdb0f41aaa943190ce949fea8d20095.png)

- **Account nickname is set**
If an account has set a nickname, for one-to-one chat messages, **nickname: push text** is displayed. For group messages, **nickname (group name): push text** is displayed.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/04d71f109d6f56f9815a3c6d0fabf464.png)

- **Display format of combined messages**
For combined messages, the text displayed shows the push text of each message element in sequence. The following example shows a one-to-one chat message with an account nickname set, and the push text is **helloworld**. Note that the text contains no spaces. The backend connects message elements in sequence without adding any extra characters. If spaces or other characters need to be added between different message elements, the caller should take control.

                "Text": "world"
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

The received APNs JSON payload is displayed as follows on the client:

```
{
    "aps": {
        "alert": "Nickname:helloworld",   //The push text of each message element is connected in sequence.
        "badge": 5,                       
        "sound": "dingdong.aiff"         //Corresponds to the `Sound` field in `TIMCustomElem`.
    }, 
    "ext": "www.qq.com"                //Corresponds to the `Ext` field in `TIMCustomElem`.
}

```

## Description of Offline Push OfflinePushInfo

`OfflinePushInfo` is a JSON object dedicated for configuring offline push. `OfflinePushInfo` allows you to configure whether to disable push, push text description content, and push passthrough strings for a message. With `OfflinePushInfo`, you can easily set offline push information, removing the need to encapsulate through `TIMCustomElem`.

>If `OfflinePushInfo` has been filled in, the offline push settings in `TIMCustomElem` are ignored. Currently, `OfflinePushInfo` can work with APNs and the push services of various Android device brands, including Xiaomi, Huawei, MEIZU, OPPO, and Vivo.

The following example shows the format of `OfflinePushInfo`:

```
{
    // ...
    "MsgBody": [...] //Same with `MsgBody` in this case
    "OfflinePushInfo": {
        "PushFlag": 0,
        "Title":"This is the push title",
        "Desc": "This is the offline push content",
        "Ext": "This is the passthrough content",
        "AndroidInfo": { 
			"Sound": "android.mp3",
			"OPPOChannelID": "test_OPPO_channel_id"
        },
        "ApnsInfo": {
            "Sound": "apns.mp3",
            "BadgeMode": 1,
            "Title":"apns title",
            "SubTitle":"apns subtitle",
            "Image":"www.image.com"
        }
    }
}
```

The preceding fields are described as follows:

| Field | Type | Property | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| PushFlag | Integer | Optional | 0: enable push, 1: disable offline push. |
| Title | String | Optional | The offline push title. This field is applicable to both iOS and Android. |
| Desc | String | Optional | Offline push content. |
| Ext | String | Optional | The passthrough content of offline push. |
| AndroidInfo.Sound | String | Optional | The file path for the offline push sound in Android. |
| AndroidInfo.OPPOChannelID | String | Optional | This field is used for NotificationChannel notifications in OPPO mobile phones with Android 8.0 or later. |
| ApnsInfo.BadgeMode | Integer | Optional | The default value or 0 indicates that counting is required. 1 indicates that counting is not required for this message, in which case the number in the upper-right icon does not increase. |
| ApnsInfo.Title | String | Optional | This field identifies the title of APNs push messages. The top-level title is replaced when this field is filled in. |
| ApnsInfo.SubTitle | String | Optional | This field identifies the subtitle of APNs push messages. |
| ApnsInfo.Image | String | Optional | This field identifies the image URL carried by APNs. When the client obtains this field, it displays the image in a pop-up window by downloading the image through the URL. |

>The maximum data packet size supported by APNs is 4 KB. Therefore, we recommend that the total size of the `Desc` and `Ext` fields does not exceed 3 KB.
