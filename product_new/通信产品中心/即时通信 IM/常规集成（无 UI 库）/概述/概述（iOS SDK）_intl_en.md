## IM SDK Concepts

**Conversation:** there are two types of conversations in the IM SDK. One is the **C2C conversation**, which is a one-to-one chat between users with messages read and sent within the conversation. The other is the **group conversation**, which is a group chat where all group members can receive messages. 

**Message:** a message in the IM SDK is the information to be sent to the recipient. A message includes properties such as whether it was read by yourself, whether it was sent successfully, the senderâ€™s account, and the message generation time. A message consists of several `Elems`, which can be text, images, emojis, and others. A message can contain multiple `Elems`.

**Group ID:** a group ID uniquely identifies a group. It is generated by the backend and returned when a group is created.
