## IM SDK Concepts
**Conversation:** there are two types of conversations in the IM SDK. One is the C2C conversation, which is a one-to-one chat between users with messages read and sent within the conversation. The other is the group conversation, which is a group chat where all group members can receive messages.

**Message:** a message in the IM SDK is the information to be sent to the recipient. A message includes properties such as whether it was read by yourself, whether is was sent successfully, the senderâ€™s account, and the message generation time. A message consists of several Elems, which can be text, images, emojis, and others. A message can contain multiple Elems.

**Group ID:** a group ID uniquely identifies a group. It is generated by the backend and returned when a group is created.

## Introduction to IM SDK Objects
IM SDK objects include the communication manager, conversation, message, and group management. The following table describes them in detail.

| Object | Description | Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TIMManager | Manager, which is responsible for basic operations of the IM SDK | Initialization, login, logout, and creating conversations |
| TIMConversation | Conversation, which is responsible for conversation-related operations | Sending messages, obtaining cached conversation messages, and obtaining the unread count |
| TIMMessage | Message | Support various message types including text and image messages |
| TIMGroupManager | Group manager | Creating groups, joining groups, and quitting groups |
| TIMFriendshipManager | Profile and relationship chain manager | Obtaining and modifying profiles and relationship chains |

## Calling Sequence
The IM SDK call APIs in the following sequence, and other methods will be called after login succeeds.
