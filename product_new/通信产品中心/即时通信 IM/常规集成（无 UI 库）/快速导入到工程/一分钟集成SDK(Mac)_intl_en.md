This document describes how to quickly integrate the Tencent Cloud IM SDK (Mac) into your projects. To configure and integrate the SDK, follow these steps.

## Development Environment Requirements
- Xcode 9.0+.
- Mac device running OS X 10.10 or later.
- The project has been configured with a valid developer signature.

## Integrating the IM SDK
You can either automatically integrate the IM SDK by using CocoaPods, or manually download the SDK and import it to your current project.

### Automatically loading CocoaPods
#### 1. Install CocoaPods
Run the following command in a terminal window (you need to install the Ruby environment on your Mac device in advance):
```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

#### 2. Create a Podfile
Navigate to the path where the project is located and run the following command. Then, a Podfile will appear under the project path.
```
pod init
```

#### 3. Edit the Podfile
Edit the Podfile as follows:

```
platform :macos, '10.10'
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

target 'mac_test' do
pod 'TXIMSDK_Mac'
end
```

#### 4. Update and install the SDK
Run the following command in a terminal window to update the local library file and install TXIMSDK_Mac:
```
pod install
```
Alternatively, run the following command to update the local library version:
```
pod update
```

After the pod command is executed, a project file integrated with the SDK and suffixed .xcworkspace will be generated. Double-click the file to open it.

### Manual integration
#### 1. Obtain the SDK download URL from [Github](https://github.com/tencentyun/TIMSDK):


- ImSDKForMac.framework is the core dynamic library file of the IM SDK.

| Pack Name | Description | ipa Increment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ImSDKForMac.framework | IM feature pack | 1.4 MB |

#### 2. Integrate the IM SDK

**Add the dependent library:** select the **Target** of Demo. On the **General** panel, add the dependent library under **Embedded Binaries** and **Linked Frameworks and Libraries**.

**Add the dependent library:**
```
ImSDKForMac.framework
```
>You need to add `-ObjC` in **Build Setting** > **Other Linker Flags**.

## Referencing the IM SDK
Use the SDK in project code in two ways:
- Method 1: Navigate to **Xcode** > **Build Setting** > **Header Search Paths**, and set the ImSDKForMac.framework/Headers path. In files that require the SDK API, directly reference the header file "ImSDK.h".
```
#import "ImSDK.h"
```

- Method 2: in the files that require the SDK API, import the header file <ImSDKForMac/ImSDK.h>.
```
#import <ImSDKForMac/ImSDK.h>
```
