## Feature Description
This API is used to import an app-owned account into IM to create an internal ID for the account. In this way, the account can use the IM service even if it has never logged in to IM before.
For example, if an app developer uses this RESTful API to send a message to user A who has never logged in to IM, the message cannot be sent because no internal ID is available for user A. Therefore, the app developer needs to import user A’s account into IM to enable the system to create an internal ID for user A. Then, the app developer can use this RESTful API to send messages to user A.

> If the same account is imported repeatedly, only one internal ID will be created for the account.
