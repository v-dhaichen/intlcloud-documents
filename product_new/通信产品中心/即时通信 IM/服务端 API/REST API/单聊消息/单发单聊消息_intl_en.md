## Feature Description
- When the admin sends a message to an account, the recipient will find that the message sender is the admin.
- When the admin specifies an account to send a message to another account, the recipient will find that the sender is not the admin but the account specified by the admin.
- This API does not check whether the sender and the recipient are friends (nor check the blacklist) or whether the recipient is muted.

> When the server sends one-to-one chat messages through this RESTful API, you can choose whether to synchronize the messages to the sender (the admin account or another account specified by the admin). In this case, available synchronization methods are synchronizing through online terminals and through the roaming server. The RESTful API provides the **SyncOtherMachine** parameter to determine whether to synchronize the messages. For details, see "Request packet examples" below.

## Error Codes

Unless a network error (such as error 502) occurs, the HTTP return code for this API is always 200. ErrorCode and ErrorInfo in the response packet represent the actual error code and error information, respectively.
For common error codes (60000 to 79999), see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34348).
The following table describes the error codes specific to this API.

| Error Code | Description |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 20001 | The request packet is invalid. |
| 20002 | UserSig or A2 is invalid. |
| 20003 | The UserID of the sender or recipient is invalid or does not exist. In this case, check whether the UserID has been imported into IM. |
| 20004 | A network exception occurred. In this case, try again. |
| 20005 | An internal server error occurred. In this case, try again. |
| 20006 | The callback before sending a one-to-one chat message is triggered, and the app backend returns a response that forbids the message to be sent. |
| 20009 | The message cannot be sent because the sender and the recipient are not friends (this problem occurs only when friendship verification for one-to-one chat messages is enabled.) |
| 20010 | The one-to-one chat message cannot be sent to the target user because you are not the userâ€™s friend (one-way relationship). |
| 20011 | The one-to-one message cannot be sent to the target user because the user is not your friend (one-way relationship). |
| 20012 | The sender has been muted, and therefore the message cannot be sent. |
| 90001 | Failed to parse the JSON request packet. In this case, check whether the request packet meets JSON specifications. |
| 90002 | The MsgBody format in the JSON request packet does not meet message format requirements, or MsgBody is not set to Array. For details, see the definition of the [TIMMsgElement Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33527#.E6.B6.88.E6.81.AF.E5.85.83.E7.B4.A0-timmsgelement). |
| 90003 | The JSON request packet does not include the To_Account field or the To_Account field is not of the String type. |
| 90005 | The JSON request packet does not include the MsgRandom field or the MsgRandom field is not of the Integer type. |
| 90006 | The MsgTimeStamp field in the JSON request packet is not of the Integer type. |
| 90007 | MsgBody in the JSON request packet is not Array. In this case, change the type to Array. |
| 90009 | The request requires app admin permissions. |
| 90010 | The JSON request packet does not meet message format requirements. For details, see the definition of the [TIMMsgElement Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33527#.E6.B6.88.E6.81.AF.E5.85.83.E7.B4.A0-timmsgelement). |
| 90011 | The number of target accounts to which messages are sent exceeds 500. In this case, reduce the number of target accounts in To_Account. |
| 90012 | To_Account is not registered or does not exist. In this case, check whether To_Account has been imported into IM or is misspelled. |
| 90026 | The retention period of offline messages is invalid. The period cannot exceed 7 days. |
| 90031 | The SyncOtherMachine field in the JSON request packet is not of the Integer type. |
| 90044 | The MsgLifeTime field in the JSON request packet is not of the Integer type. |
| 91000 | An internal service error occurred. In this case, try again. |
| 90992 | An internal server error occurred. In this case, try again. If this error code is returned for all requests and the app has configured third-party callback, check whether the app server sends the callback result to the IM backend server normally. |
