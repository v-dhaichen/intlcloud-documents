## Feature Description
 Through this API, the app admin can add new members to a specified group.

## API Invocation Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type | Support This RESTful API |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes |
| Public | Yes |
| ChatRoom | Yes |
| AVChatRoom | No (see description below) |

IM provides the preceding five built-in group types. For details, see [Group Systems](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

### Request packet examples

- **Basic form**
Invites users to a group. A single request supports adding up to 500 members. By default, the backend will deliver group system notifications to all group members (except for Private groups that have not been activated).
```
{
    "GroupId": "@TGS#2J4SZEAEL", // The group to be operated on (required)
    "MemberList": [ // A maximum of 500 members can be added at a time.
    {
        "Member_Account": "tommy" // The ID of the group member to be added (required)
    },
    {
        "Member_Account": "jared"
    }]
}
```

- **Adding Members Silently**
When **Silence** is set to 1, the system will not notify anyone after successfully adding members.
```
{
    "GroupId": "@TGS#2J4SZEAEL", // Target group (required)
    "Silence": 1, // Whether to add members silently (optional)
    "MemberList": [ // A maximum of 500 members can be added at a time
    {
        "Member_Account": "tommy" // ID of the group member to be added (required)
    },
    {
        "Member_Account": "jared"
    }]
}
```

| MemberList | Array | Required | The array of the group members to be added. |

    "ErrorCode": 0,

    },
    {
         "Member_Account": "jared",
         "Result": 1
    }]
}
```

### Response packet fields

## Error Codes
Unless a network error (such as error 502) occurs, the HTTP return code for this API is always 200. ErrorCode and ErrorInfo in the response packet represent the actual error code and error information, respectively.
For common error codes (60000 to 79999), see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34348).
The following table describes the error codes specific to this API.

| Error Code | Description |
|---------|---------|
| 10002 | An internal server error occurred. In this case, try again. |
| 10003 | The request command keyword is invalid. |
| 10004 | A parameter is invalid. In this case, check whether request parameters are correct based on the error description. |
| 10005 | The number of Member_Accounts in the request packet exceeds 500. |
| 10007 | Operation permissions are insufficient. In this case, check whether the type of the group supports user invitation. For example, AVChatRoom and BChatRoom groups disallow anyone to invite others to the groups. |
| 10014 | The user in the request cannot be added to the group because the group is already full. In this case, reduce the number of Member_Accounts in the request or change the value of the MaxMemberNum field in the basic group information. For information on the basic group information, see [Basic Group Information](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529#.E7.BE.A4.E5.9F.BA.E7.A1.80.E8.B5.84.E6.96.99). |
| 10010 | The group does not exist or has been dismissed. |
| 10015 | The group ID is invalid. In this case, check whether the group ID is correct. |
| 10016 | The developer backend rejects this operation through a third-party callback. |
| 10019 | The requested UserID  does not exist. In this case, check whether all Member_Accounts in MemberList are correct. |
| 10026 | The command keyword requested by SDKAppID is disabled. In this case, contact our customer service. |
| 10037 | The number of groups that the invited user has joined exceeds the limit. In this case, check and delete the Member_Account that has joined excessive groups, or **purchase an upgrade** based on the actual need.
