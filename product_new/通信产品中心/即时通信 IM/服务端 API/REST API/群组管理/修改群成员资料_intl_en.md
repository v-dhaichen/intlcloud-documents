## Feature Description
 The app admin can modify group members’ profiles through this API.

## API Invocation Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type | Support This RESTful API |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes |
| Public | Yes |
| ChatRoom | Yes |
| AVChatRoom | Support modifying the profiles of the admin and group owner |
| BChatRoom | No |

IM supports the preceding five types of groups. For details, see [Group Systems](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

> For AVChatRoom groups, only the profiles of the admin and group owner can be modified due to internal implementation reasons. If you try to modify an ordinary member’s profile, error 10007 returns.

For common error codes (60000 to 79999), see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34348).
The following table describes the error codes specific to this API.
