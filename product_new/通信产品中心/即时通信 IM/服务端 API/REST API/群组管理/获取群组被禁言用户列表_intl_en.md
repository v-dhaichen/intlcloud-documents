For common error codes (60000 to 79999), see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34348).
The following table describes the error codes specific to this API.

| 10002 | An internal server error occurred. To correct it, try again. |
| 10003 | The request command word is invalid. |
| 10004 | A parameter is invalid. To correct it, check whether request parameters are correct based on the error description. |
