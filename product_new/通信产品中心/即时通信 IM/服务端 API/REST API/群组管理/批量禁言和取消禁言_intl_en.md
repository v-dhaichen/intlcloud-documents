## API Invocation Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type | Support this RESTful API |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | No (see the following note) |
| Public | Yes |
| ChatRoom | Yes |
| AVChatRoom | Yes |
| BChatRoom | No (see the following note) |

IM provides the preceding five built-in group types. For details on these types, see [Group Systems](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

>
>- Private group members cannot be muted.
>- In a BChatRoom group, only the app admin can send messages. Therefore, muting and unmuting are unnecessary in this case.

Unless a network error (such as error 502) occurs, the HTTP return code for this API is always 200. ErrorCode and ErrorInfo in the response packet represent the actual error code and error information, respectively.
For common error codes (60000 to 79999), see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34348).
The following table describes the error codes specific to this API:

| Error Code | Description |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 10002 | An internal server error occurred. In this case, try again. |
| 10003 | A request command keyword is invalid. |
| 10004 | A parameter is invalid. In this case, check whether the request is correct based on the error description. |
