## API Invocation Description

### Applicable group types

| Group Type | Support This RESTful API |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes |
| Public | Yes |
| ChatRoom | Yes |
| AVChatRoom | No (see description below) |
| BChatRoom | No (see description below) |

IM provides the preceding five built-in group types. For details, see [Group Systems](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

>
>- AVChatRoom groups do not support deleting group members. If you try to delete the members of an AVChatRoom group, error 10004 returns. To achieve the effect of deleting a member, the admin can use [Batch Muting and Unmuting](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34951).
>- BChatRoom groups do not support deleting group members. If you try to delete the members of a BChatRoom group, error 10004 returns. This type of groups only allow the app admin to push broadcast messages.

### Request packet examples

- **Basic form**
This API is used to delete group members. One request can delete a maximum of 500 members. By default, the backend will send system notifications to all group members when a member is deleted (except for private groups that have not been activated).
Even if the user to be deleted is not in the group, the API will still return success.
```
{
    "GroupId": "@TGS#2J4SZEAEL", // The target group (required).
    "MemberToDel_Account": [ // The list of group members to be deleted. A maximum of 500 members can be deleted.
        "tommy",
        "jared"
    ]
}
```
- **Silent deletion**
When Silence is set to 1, the system will not notify anyone after successfully deleting a member.
```
{
    "GroupId": "@TGS#2J4SZEAEL", // The target group (required).
    "Silence": 1, // Whether to delete silently (optional).
    "MemberToDel_Account": [ // The list of group members to be deleted. A maximum of 500 members can be deleted.
        "tommy",
        "jared"
    ]
}
```
- **Specifying the reason for removal**
If the reason for removing a user from a group is specified, it will be reflected in the delivered notification.
```
{
    "GroupId": "@TGS#2J4SZEAEL", // The target group (required).
    "Reason": "kick reason", // The reason for removing the member from the group.
    "MemberToDel_Account": [ // The list of group members to be deleted. A maximum of 500 members can be deleted.
        "tommy",
        "jared"
    ]
}
```

### Request packet fields

| Field | Type | Attribute | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| GroupId | String | Required | The ID of the target group. |
| Silence | Integer | Optional | Whether to adopt silent deletion. 0: no. 1: yes. Silent deletion means that no members in the group, except the deleted member, will be notified of the deletion. The default value of this field is 0. |
| Reason | String | Optional | The reason for removing the member from the group. |
| MemberToDel_Account | Array | Required | Group members to be deleted. |

### Response packet example
```
{
    "ActionStatus": "OK",
    "ErrorInfo": "",
    "ErrorCode": 0
}
```

### Response packet fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ActionStatus | String | The request processing result. OK: succeeded. FAIL: failed. |
| ErrorCode | Integer | The error code. 0: succeeded. Others: failed. |
| ErrorInfo | String | Error information. |

## Error Codes
Unless a network error (such as error 502) occurs, the HTTP return code for this API is always 200. ErrorCode and ErrorInfo in the response packet represent the actual error code and error information, respectively.
For common error codes (60000 to 79999), see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34348).
The following table describes the error codes specific to this API.

| Error Code | Description |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 10002 | An internal server error occurred. In this case, try again. |
| 10003  | A request command keyword is invalid. |
| 10004 | A parameter is invalid. In this case, check whether request parameters are correct based on the error description. |
| 10007 | Operation permissions are insufficient. For example, an ordinary member in a public group attempts to remove a member from the group, but only the app admin has the permission to do so. |
| 10010 | The group does not exist or has been dismissed. |
| 10015 | The group ID is invalid. In this case, check whether the group ID is correct. |
