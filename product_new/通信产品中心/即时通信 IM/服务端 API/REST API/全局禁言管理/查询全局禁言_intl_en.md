## Background
- Global muting includes the global muting of one-to-one chat messages and that of group chat messages.
- By default, the global muting of one-to-one chat messages is disabled for accounts. If the global muting of one-to-one chat messages is enabled for an account, all one-to-one chat messages fail to be sent during the muting period. After the muting period expires, the IM backend system automatically disables the global muting of one-to-one chat messages, and then all one-to-one chat messages can be sent normally. For the permanent global muting of one-to-one chat messages, the muting period never expires.
- By default, the global muting of group chat messages is disabled for accounts. If the global muting of group chat messages is enabled for an account, all group chat messages fail to be sent during the muting period. After the muting period expires, the IM backend system automatically disables the global muting of group chat messages, and then all group chat messages can be sent normally. For the permanent global muting of group chat messages, the muting period never expires.

## Feature Description
- Query the account’s setting of global muting of one-to-one chat messages.
- Query the account’s setting of global muting of group chat messages.
