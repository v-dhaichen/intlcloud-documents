## Feature Description

Through this callback, the app backend can monitor usersâ€™ one-to-one chat messages in real time, including:
- Recording one-to-one chat messages in real time (for example, recording a log or synchronizing messages to other systems).
- Calculating statistics for one-to-one chat messages (for example, the number of users or that of messages).

## Precautions

- To enable this callback, you must configure the callback URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For details on the configuration method, see [Third-Party Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- Callback direction: the IM backend initiates an HTTPS POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.
- If the callback before sending one-to-one chat messages and the callback after sending one-to-one chat messages are both enabled and the callback before sending one-to-one chat messages returns muting, the callback after sending one-to-one chat messages will not be triggered.
- If the callback before sending one-to-one chat messages and the callback after sending one-to-one chat messages are both enabled and the callback before sending one-to-one chat messages modifies the message body, the callback after sending one-to-one chat messages will use the modified message for callback.
- For other security-related issues, see [Third-Party Callback Overview: Security Considerations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354#.E5.AE.89.E5.85.A8.E8.80.83.E8.99.91).

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

-  An app user uses a client to send a one-to-one chat message.
-  The app admin sends a one-to-one chat message through the RESTful API (SendMsg).

## Callback Triggering Time

The callback is triggered after the IM backend receives a one-to-one chat message sent by a user and sends the message to the target user.

> If the message fails to be delivered (for example, due to illegal word filtering), this callback will still be triggered.

## API Description

### Request URL example

In the following example, the callback URL configured in the app is `https://www.example.com`.
**Example:**

```

```

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| https | The request protocol is HTTPS, and the request method is POST. |
| www.example.com | The callback URL. |
| SdkAppid | The SDKAppID assigned by the IM console when an app is created. |
| CallbackCommand | The value is fixed to C2C.CallbackAfterSendMsg. |
| contenttype | The value is fixed to JSON. |
| ClientIP | The client IP address, whose format is similar to: 127.0.0.1. |
| OptPlatform | The client platform. For details on the possible values, see the OptPlatform parameter in [Third-Party Callback Overview: Callback Protocols](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354#.E5.9B.9E.E8.B0.83.E5.8D.8F.E8.AE.AE). |
