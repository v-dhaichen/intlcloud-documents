## Feature Description

The app backend uses this callback to monitor information about friends added by users in real time.

## Precautions

- To enable this callback, you must configure the callback URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For details on the configuration method, see [Third-Party Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- Callback direction: the IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.
- For other security-related issues, see [Third-Party Callback Overview: Security Considerations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354#.E5.AE.89.E5.85.A8.E8.80.83.E8.99.91).

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- The app backend uses the RESTful API to initiate a two-way friend addition request, and the peer’s friend request verification mode is "AllowAny".
- The app backend uses the client to initiate a two-way friend addition request, and the peer’s friend verification mode is "AllowAny".
- The app backend uses the RESTful API to initiate a one-way friend addition request.
- The app backend uses the client to initiate a one-way friend addition request.
- After receiving the friend addition request, the app user permits to add the peer as a friend.
- The app backend uses the RESTful API to forcibly add a friend.

## Callback Triggering Time

This callback is triggered when a friend is successfully added.

> This callback will not be triggered if the API for [importing friends](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34903) is invoked to add a friend.
