## Feature Description

The app backend uses this callback to monitor information about users added to the blacklist in real time.

## Precautions

- To enable this callback, you must configure the callback URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For details on the configuration method, see [Third-Party Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- Callback direction: the IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.
- For other security-related issues, see [Third-Party Callback Overview: Security Considerations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354#.E5.AE.89.E5.85.A8.E8.80.83.E8.99.91).

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- An app user uses the client to initiate a request for adding a user to the blacklist.
- The app backend initiates a request for adding a user to the blacklist through the RESTful API.

## Callback Triggering Time

The callback is triggered when the IM backend receives a request for adding a user to the blacklist and successfully adds the user to the blacklist.

## API Description

### Request URL example

In the following example, the callback URL configured in the app is `https://www.example.com`.
