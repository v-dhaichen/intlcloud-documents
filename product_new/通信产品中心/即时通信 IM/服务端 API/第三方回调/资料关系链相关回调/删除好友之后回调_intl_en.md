## Feature Description

The app backend can use this callback to monitor information about deleting friends by users in real time.

## Notes

- To enable this callback, you must configure the callback URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For details on the configuration method, see [Third-Party Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- Callback direction: the IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.
- For other security-related issues, see [Third-Party Callback Overview: Security Considerations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354#.E5.AE.89.E5.85.A8.E8.80.83.E8.99.91).

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- An app user uses a client to initiate a friend deletion request.
- The app backend initiates a friend deletion request through the RESTful API.

## Callback Triggering Time

The callback will be performed after the IM backend receives a friend deletion request and successfully deletes the friend.
