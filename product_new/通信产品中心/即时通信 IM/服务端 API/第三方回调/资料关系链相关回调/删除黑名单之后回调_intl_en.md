## Feature Description

Through this callback, the app backend can monitor the deletion of user blacklists in real time.

## Precautions

- To enable this callback, you must configure the callback URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For details on the configuration method, see [Third-Party Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- Callback direction: The IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.
- For other security-related issues, see [Third-Party Callback Overview: Security Considerations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354#.E5.AE.89.E5.85.A8.E8.80.83.E8.99.91).

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- An app user uses a client to initiate a blacklist deletion request.
- The app backend initiates a blacklist deletion request through the RESTful API.

## Callback Triggering Time

The callback is triggered after the IM backend receives a blacklist deletion request and successfully deletes the blacklist.
