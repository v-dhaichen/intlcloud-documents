## Feature Description

The app backend system uses this callback to monitor group member addition messages in real time. This callback can notify the app backend system that new members are added to the group so that the app can perform necessary data synchronization.

## Precautions

- To enable this callback, you must configure the callback URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For details on the configuration method, see [Third-Party Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- Callback direction: The IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving a callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.
- For other security-related issues, see [Third-Party Callback Overview: Security Considerations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354#.E5.AE.89.E5.85.A8.E8.80.83.E8.99.91).

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- An app user actively requests to join a group through the client, and the request is approved.
- An app user successfully adds other users to a group through the client.
- An app admin adds users to a group through the RESTful API.

## Callback Triggering Times

- A user actively requests to join a group and successfully joins the group.
- A user is invited by another member to join a group and successfully joins the group.
- An app admin adds the user to a group through the RESTful API.
