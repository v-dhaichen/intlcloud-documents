## Feature Description

Through this callback, the app backend can monitor users’ group creation requests in real time. The backend can reject users’ requests for creating groups.

## Notes

- To enable the callback, you must configure the callback URL and toggle on the callback protocol. For details on the configuration method, see [Third-Party Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- The callback direction is that the IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.
- For other security-related issues, see [Third-Party Callback Introduction: Security Considerations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354#.E5.AE.89.E5.85.A8.E8.80.83.E8.99.91).

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- An app user uses a client to create a group.
- The app admin creates a group through the RESTful API.

## Callback Triggering Time

Perform the callback before the IM backend prepares to create a group.

## API Description

### Request URL example

In the following example, the callback URL configured by the app is `https://www.example.com`.

| Operator_Account | String | UserID  of the operator who initiates the group creation request |
| Owner_Account | String | UserID  of the owner of the group to be created through the request |
| Type | String | The type of the group that generates group messages, such as Private, Public, or ChatRoom. For details, see [Group Types](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529#.E7.BE.A4.E7.BB.84.E5.BD.A2.E6.80.81.E4.BB.8B.E7.BB.8D). |
