| 30007 | The network connection timed out. To correct it, try again later. |
| 30008 | A write conflict occurred due to concurrent writes. To correct it, we recommend that you use the batch mode. |
| 30009 | The backend prohibited this user from initiating friend requests. |
| 30010 | The maximum number of friends was reached. |
| 30011 | The maximum number of friend groups was reached. |
