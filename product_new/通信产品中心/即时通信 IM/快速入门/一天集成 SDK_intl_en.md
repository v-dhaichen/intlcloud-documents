To integrate the IM SDK into your app to achieve the effect, complete the following three steps:

## Step 1: Run the Demo

Scan the QR code to [download and run the Demo](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34279).
For details on how to use the IM SDK, see [Running Through the Demo in One Minute](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34553).

## Step 2: Integrate the SDK
TUIKit is a UI component layer that encapsulates the IM SDK and contains common IM operations, such as the chat panel, conversation list, and contacts.
- To quickly integrate and use the SDK, see [Quick SDK Integration (Including UI Library)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34286).
- To use SDK APIs to customize UIs, see [Normal SDK Integration (Without the UI Library)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34301).

## Step 3: Integrate RESTful APIs for the Server End
The IM service provides server-end RESTful APIs for the app service backend to manage server-end services, such as IM service user accounts, one-to-one chat messages, group chat messages, group management, user profiles, friend relationship links, operational data, historical message download, and third-party callback.
For details on the server integration operation, see [Server-End API Documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34621).

## Step 4: (Optional) Integrate the Video Chat Service
The IM service can quickly integrate real-time audio and video TRTC services to provide services such as user video chat and group video conferencing in IM applications. Currently, only iOS supports this feature.
For details on the integration operation, see [Integrating Video Chat](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34298).
