## Introduction to TUIKit

TUIKit is a UI component library based on the IM SDK. It provides universal UI components such as the conversation list, chat UI, and contact list, enabling developers to quickly build custom IM apps according to their business needs. TUIKit can not only provide UI features through components, but also implement related IM logic and data processing by calling relevant IM SDK APIs, allowing developers to focus on their own business needs or custom extensions.
