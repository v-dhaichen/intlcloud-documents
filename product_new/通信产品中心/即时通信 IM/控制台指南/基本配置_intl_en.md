### Obtaining the key
**Keys are sensitive information, and therefore be sure to keep it confidential and prevent it from being leaked.** By default, apps (SDKAppIDs) created before August 15, 2019 use the [ECDSA-SHA256](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34385#ECDSA-SHA256) signature algorithm that uses a public key and a private key. You can update to the HMAC-SHA256 signature algorithm if needed.

1. Click **Show key** for **Key**.
2. Click **Copy** to copy and save the key.
  The key can be used to generate UserSig. For more information, see [Generating UserSig](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34385).

## Configuring Account Admins
Account admins can call RESTful APIs, dismiss groups, and perform operations on all members. You can directly use the default account admin `administrator`, or manually add new account admins.

## Activating Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC)
If you need features such as audio calling, video calling, and interactive live broadcasting in your current IM app, or you need to integrate the IM SDK and the TRTC SDK at the same time, you can activate the [TRTC service](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647) in the **Activate TRTC** area. The system will create a TRTC app in [TRTC Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc), which has the same SDKAppID as your current IM app. Both accounts and their authentication information can be reused.

1. Click **Activate Now** in the **Activate TRTC** area.
