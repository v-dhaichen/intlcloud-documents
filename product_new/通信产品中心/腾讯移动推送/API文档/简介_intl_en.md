REST API is an HTTP management API provided to the App backend by TPNS push for the remote call of push services by developers. 

REST API supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols. For the sake of security, it is recommended that the HTTPS protocol be used.

##  Prerequisites
If the REST API needs to be called, make sure that the application has been created in the TPNS push console. For details, refer to [Creating Products and Applications](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/32603).
