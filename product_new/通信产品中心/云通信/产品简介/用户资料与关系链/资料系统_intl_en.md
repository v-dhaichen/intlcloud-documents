By using IM’s profile hosting service, you will be able to:
- Store, read, and write standard profile fields.

## Profile Fields
 A profile is a set of data that describes user properties. IM’s profile system supports standard and custom profile fields. Profile fields have the following characteristics:
- Profile fields are expressed in key-value format.
- Key is of string type, and its name contains only uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Value has the following types:
   a. An integer of uint32_t type (not supported for custom fields).
   b. An integer of uint64_t type (not supported for custom fields).
   c. A string of string type (the length of the string cannot exceed 500 bytes.)
   d. A buffer of bytes type (the length of the buffer cannot exceed 500 bytes.)

- You can configure the read and write permissions for each key. The read and write permissions of profile fields are as follows:

<table style="display:table;width:100%">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
			<th style="width:20%;">Permission Name</th>
				<th style="width:30%;">Permission Type</th>
				<th>Notes</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Read permission</td>
				<td>
					Readable by app<br>
					Readable by app admin<br>
				</td>
				<td>You can select one or more types of read permission.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Write permission</td>
				<td>
					Writable by app<br>
					Writable by app admin<br>
				</td>
				<td>You can select one or more types of write permission.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

## Custom Profile Fields
Custom profile fields are the user data set by each app according to its own business needs. By using custom profile fields, an app can add additional data to user profiles and perform read and write operations through existing APIs.

### Applying for custom profile fields
To apply for custom profile fields, the app admin can log in to IM [Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im) and choose **App Configuration** > **Feature Configuration**. After the application is submitted, custom profile fields will take effect in 5 minutes.
When applying for custom profile fields, you need to submit the following information for each field:
- The name of the custom profile field (Key). For more information, see [Naming Rules for Custom Profile Fields](#.E8.87.AA.E5.AE.9A.E4.B9.89.E8.B5.84.E6.96.99.E5.AD.97.E6.AE.B5.E7.9A.84.E5.91.BD.E5.90.8D.E8.A7.84.E8.8C.83).
- The type of the custom profile field (Value). For more information, see [Profile Fields](#.E8.B5.84.E6.96.99.E5.AD.97.E6.AE.B5).
- Read and write permissions of the custom profile field. For more information, see [Profile Fields](#.E8.B5.84.E6.96.99.E5.AD.97.E6.AE.B5).

### Naming rules for custom profile fields
The rules for naming custom profile fields are as follows:
- The name of the custom profile field contains the prefix and keyword parts.
- The prefix of the custom profile field is Tag_Profile_Custom.
- Keyword: the keyword must be a string of letters with a length less than 8 bytes. We recommend you use an English word or its abbreviation as the keyword.
- Example: if the custom field to be applied for by an app has the keyword **Test**, then the name of the custom profile field is: Tag_Profile_Custom_Test.
