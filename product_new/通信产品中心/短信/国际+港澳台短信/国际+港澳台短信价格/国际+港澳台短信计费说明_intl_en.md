  For example, if an SMS message contains 320 characters, it will be billed as 3 messages (153 + 153 + 14 characters).

### SMS containing non-English characters
- One Chinese character, letter, digit, punctuation mark (both fullwidth and halfwidth forms), or space will be calculated as **1 character**.
- If an SMS message contains 70 characters or less, it will be billed as one message; otherwise, it will be billed as multiple messages based on the standard of 67 characters per message.
 For example, if an SMS message contains 150 characters, it will be billed as 3 messages (67 + 67 + 16 characters).
