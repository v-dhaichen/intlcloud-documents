Currently, SMS provides short message services within and outside Mainland China.
- For use within Mainland China, which we call Mainland China SMS, SMS supports sending messages to a single recipient or group with or without a template, getting delivery reports, and pulling replies.
- For use outside Mainland China, which we call Global SMS, the APIs for sending messages to a single recipient or group within Mainland China can be directly used after replacing the corresponding country codes and mobile numbers.
