## Event
An event in CloudAudit is a record of an activity in a Tencent Cloud account. This activity can be an operation taken by a user, role, or service that can be monitored by CloudAudit. CloudAudit events provide a history of both API and non-API account activities.  
## Event History
CloudAudit records the events in the past 30 days, and you can view, search, and download the event history. You can use this history to gain visibility into operations performed by your Tencent Cloud account in Tencent Cloud, Tencent Cloud SDK, Command Line Tool (CLI), and other Tencent Cloud services.
## Tracking Set
A tracking set is a configuration in CloudAudit used to deliver CloudAudit event logs to a COS bucket. You can use it to filter the logs you want to be delivered, encrypt your event log files with a key, and set notifications for log file delivery.
