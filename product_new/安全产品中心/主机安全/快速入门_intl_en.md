- Log in to the [CWP Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/yunjing), select **Asset Management** > **Server List** on the left sidebar, and find the server you want to query. Click the IP address of the server and click **Intrusion Detection** to view its intrusion detection details.
- Log in to the [CWP Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/yunjing), click **Intrusion Detection** on the left sidebar, and click the feature you want to view. Then, you can view the intrusion detection details of all servers with CWP enabled.
