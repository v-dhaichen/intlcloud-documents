| Advantages         | Cloud Workload Protection                                       | Other Host Security Products                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hacking behavior detection | **Based on the threat intelligence data collected from the entire internet, CWP is able to detect hacker attacks in real time.** | Determination is made based on the single-server behavior data with weak detection ability and slow response. |
| Trojan file detection | **The CWP backend is integrated with the new-gen TAV anti-virus engine of Tencent PC Manager and Hubble Analysis system to respond to unknown risks instantly. Its machine learning-based web shell detection engine can effectively combat encrypted and disguised malicious scripts.** | The ability to detect malicious files is missing, and web shell detection based on regular expressions and character logic matching leads to a lot of false positives and false negatives. |
| Installation and Ops free | **CWP can be automatically installed and activated when you [purchase a CVM instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/506). Security policies are automatically updated in the cloud, with no manual maintenance of various security detection scripts required.** | You need to log in to individual servers to manually install the product, and personnel with certain security knowledge are required to configure security policies. |
| Centralized management      | **Security events can be managed in the console in a centralized manner, eliminating your need to log in to multiple servers. Centralized management of server assets enables you to quickly construct a visualized security platform.** | You need to log in to individual servers to address security events one by one.                 |
| Low resource consumption | **With self-developed lightweight agents, CWP carries out most of its computing and protection workload in the cloud, ensuring low consumption of server resources. ** | Software clients consumes a high amount of memory resources (generally over 100 MB), which may compromise server performance during peak hours. |
