### What are the harms of server intrusion?
- Business interruption: the databases and files are tampered with or deleted, end users cannot access your services, and your system crashes.
- Data theft: hackers steal your data and sell it publicly. Your users' private data is leaked, damaging your enterprise brand image and bringing customer churning.
- File encryption by ransomware: hackers intrude your server and implant irreversible encrypted ransomware to encrypt your data for ransom.
- Unstable service: hackers run cryptomining malware or DDoS trojan programs on your server, consuming a large amount of system resources and making the server unable to provide normal service.

### How to automatically back up data using snapshot?
Snapshot is a data backup method provided by Tencent Cloud. It can create a fully-available duplicate of the specified cloud disk, whose lifecycle is independent of the lifecycle of the original cloud disk. You can create snapshots regularly to quickly recover data in case of accidental data loss.
You can create a snapshot in the console as instructed below:
1. Log in to the [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/overview).
2. Click **Cloud Block Storage** on the left sidebar.
3. Find the row of the desired instance and click **Create Snapshot**.
4. Wait until the snapshot is created.

- If necessary, you are recommended to reset the server and then set up a complex password containing at least 15 letters, number, and special characters.

### What to do if suspicious logins are detected?
CWP judges whether a login attempt is normal according to the list the common login locations. Please check the login log carefully. If a login was not intended, the password may have been compromised. In this case, you need to perform a detailed security check on the server.
