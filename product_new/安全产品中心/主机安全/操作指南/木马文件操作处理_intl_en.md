#### Dealing with suspicious files
- **Quarantine** 
After malicious files are confirmed, you can quarantine a single file or multiple files in batches. After successful quarantine, the original malicious files will be encrypted and quarantined. You can filter **quarantined** files to recover them in the future if necessary.
- **Trust**
If a file is not malicious, you can trust it. After the file is added to the trust list, CWP will not inspect it again. You can filter the **trusted files** to manage them.
- **Delete Log**
After a record is deleted, you cannot view related information. You are recommended to **quarantine** or **trust** a file before deleting it. You can also go to the file path to manually delete it.
