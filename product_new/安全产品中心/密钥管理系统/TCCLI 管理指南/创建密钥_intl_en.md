## Overview
The CreateKey API can be called to create a customer master key (CMK) used for DEK management. The CMK can be used in other APIs to create DEKs, perform encryption and decryption, and do more.

The `Alias` parameter is required for this API. You can add other descriptions for the CMK as instructed in the [CreateKey](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1030/32199) API document.

The examples below are called with [TCCLI](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/cli), which can also be called with any supported programming languages.



## Examples
This example shows you how to create a key named `test-gz01` in Guangzhou region with the description `this is test for gz key`.
#### Input
```shell
tccli kms CreateKey --region ap-guangzhou --Alias test-gz01 --Description 'this is test for gz key'
```

#### Output
