Anti-DDoS Pro allows you to recover blocked IPs by yourself in [Anti-DDoS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dayu/overview).

## Chances for Self-recovery

Each user has **three** chances to recover blocked IPs per day. The quota is reset every day at midnight. Unused chances will be cleared can cannot be accumulated to the following day.

>- The recovery may fail due to risk control reasons. A failed attempt does not take a chance. Please wait for a while and then try again.
>- Before recovering the IP, please check the predicted recovery time. The recovery time may be affected by some factors and will be postponed. If you accept the predicted time, you do not need to operate manually.
>- If the self-recovery chances are used up for the day, you can upgrade the base protection capability or the elastic protection capability to defend against large traffic attack and avoid continuous blocking.
