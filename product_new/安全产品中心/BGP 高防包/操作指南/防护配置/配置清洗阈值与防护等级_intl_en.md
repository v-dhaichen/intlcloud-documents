Log in to [Anti-DDoS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dayu/bgp_v2), choose **Anti-DDoS Pro** -> **Protection Configuration**, and select the target instance from the drop-down list. In the **DDoS Protection** section, configure **Protection Status**, **Cleansing Threshold**, **Protection Level**, **Scenario**, and **Advanced Policy**.
>The configuration items are visible only when **Protection Status** is <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/9f12e685bdc6e7269f8b6d56932972e5.png"  style="margin:0;">. If you disable the protection, the configuration items will be hidden and do not take effect. After you enable the protection again, the items will be visible and retain the original configuration.

- ### Protection Status
You can enable or disable the protection as required. You can set the duration for disabling the protection. Currently, the duration is 1-6 hours. The protection automatically takes effect after the set duration or when the attack traffic exceeds 1 million pps or 2 Gbps.

- ### Cleansing Threshold
Indicates the the threshold to trigger cleansing. If the traffic is below the threshold, the cleansing operation is not executed even if attacks are detected.
>If you have a clear concept about the threshold, set it as required. Otherwise please leave it to the default value. Anti-DDoS will automatically learn through AI algorithms and generate the default threshold for you.

- ### Protection Level
You can set the protection level as required. The following table details the operations for each protection level.

 >If you need to use UDP protocol, please contact [Tencent Cloud Technical Support](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/support) to formulate a policy to avoid impact on business operations when in strict mode.


- ###  Scenarios
 Select a matching one from the created scenarios, and modify its configuration as required. After you have selected a scenario, the corresponding advanced policy will automatically match the policy generated for the scenario.
	
- ### Advanced Policy
You can select a matching one from the created advanced policies as required. You can also modify an existing advanced policy.
