Tencent Cloud Game Multimedia Engine (GME) is a one-stop voice solution featuring high quality and cost effectiveness, which covers a wide range of internet-based application scenarios, such as gaming, social networking, entertainment, live broadcasting, and ecommerce. It supports group voice chat, 3D location voice, voice messaging and speech-to-text, and voice analysis.

### Voice Chat Service

#### 3D sound effects
Leveraging HRTF, 3D spatial processing, and distance-based EQ compensation technologies, GME can create a voice model based on human perception to process and convert non-directional sound into 3D immersive sound, thereby generating the sound sensation to human ears as if from a sound source at any spatial position.

#### Public messaging
Public voice within a certain range with 3D sound effects in 6 directions is supported.

#### Mic sequence mode
Users take turns to speak with mic on. This mode allows a high sound quality and fluency and is suitable for such scenarios as Werewolf.

#### Free audio call
This mode allows multiple players to speak at the same time with ultra low latency, which is suitable for competitive gaming scenarios such as multi-player team chat.

#### Command mode
This mode is suitable for one-to-many commanding, audio interaction with host and other scenarios in large-scale commander games.

### Voice Message and Speech-to-text Service
GME supports sending recorded voice messages to game channels and converting them into text messages in real time, with clear sound quality and high accuracy of voice recognition.
