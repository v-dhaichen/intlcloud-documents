## Overview

You can group cross-region and cross-project instances of a cloud product for unified management. When creating a large number of instances, you can create instance groups as needed. By managing instance groups, you can better manage instances, configure alarm policies, and improve OPS efficiency.

## Notes

- Each instance group can contain up to 2,000 instances, and a maximum of 200 instances can be added to an instance group at a time.
- By grouping instances, you can manage cross-region and cross-project cloud product instances in a unified manner and configure alarm policies to avoid repeated operations and improve OPS efficiency.
