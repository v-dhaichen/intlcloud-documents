## Overview
Cloud Product Monitor is a unified presentation platform that integrates detailed monitoring information in the Cloud Monitoring console. Users can view the list of cloud resources and monitoring as well as alarm details under their accounts.
Compared with the business console that displays monitoring data, the Cloud Product Monitor console enables health check and displays alarm data. Users can quickly locate abnormal instances and troubleshoot problems based on specific data and exceptions.

## Steps
1. Log in to the [Cloud Monitor](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor) console.
2. On the left sidebar, choose **Cloud Product Monitor** > **Cloud Virtual Machine** to access the monitoring list page for Cloud Virtual Machines (CVMs).
3. Locate the CVM to be viewed and click its name to access the monitoring page.
