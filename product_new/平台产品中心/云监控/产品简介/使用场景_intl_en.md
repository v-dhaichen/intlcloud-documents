### Cloud product monitoring

After purchasing and using a Tencent Cloud product supported by Cloud Monitoring (CM), you can access the [Cloud Monitoring console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/overview) to view various metrics such as the product running status, and set alarm rules for monitoring items.

### Custom Monitoring

Custom monitoring supplements the basic monitoring of cloud products. If CM does not provide the monitoring items you need for a product, you can create a monitoring item and collect monitoring data to report to CM. CM can create charts and alarm features for the new monitoring item, allowing you to view the health status of your services in real time.

### Event Monitoring

CM can monitor various Tencent Cloud product resources, the service lifecycle of underlying platform infrastructures, and important event information during operation. It allows you to query event-type report data and set alarms.

### Prompt Troubleshooting

According to your alarm policies, CM sends you alarm messages when the monitoring data reaches the alarm threshold. This allows you to promptly receive notifications about exceptions and query the causes.

### Prompt Expansion

After setting alarm rules for certain monitoring items, such as bandwidth, number of associations, and disk utilization, you can easily check cloud product status. If your service volume increases, you can receive prompt alarm notifications and quickly expand relevant services based on the monitoring data.
