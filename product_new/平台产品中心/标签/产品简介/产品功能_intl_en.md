This product is mainly used to query resources and create tags.
## Querying resources
You can query and tag your existing resources on Tencent Cloud by region, type, and instance. The found resources are displayed in a list. You can also specify a tag key for these resources according to your needs for classification and management.

## Creating Tags
Using Tag service is equivalent to creating a database locally. It stores all of your resource tag keys and tag values in Tencent Cloud and helps you manage your resources in the future. Creating a tag includes creating a tag key and a tag value.
