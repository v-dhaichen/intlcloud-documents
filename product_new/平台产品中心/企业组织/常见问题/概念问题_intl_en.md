### What is an organization?
An organization refers to a series of Tencent Cloud accounts that you can organize into a hierarchy and manage centrally.

### What is a Tencent Cloud account?

A Tencent Cloud account is a container for your Tencent Cloud resources. You can create and manage your Tencent Cloud resources within your Tencent Cloud account with the management features provided, such as access control and billing methods.

### What is a master account?

A master account refers to a Tencent Cloud account that is used to create an organization. When using the master account, you can create new accounts within the organization, invite other accounts to join your organization and manage these invitations, as well as delete accounts from your organization. You can also associate policies with entities such as the administrative root, organizational units, or accounts in the organization.

### What is a member account?

A member account is a Tencent Cloud account in the organization that is not the master account. One member account can only belong to one organization at a time. 

### What is the administrative root?

The administrative root is the starting point for organizing Tencent Cloud accounts. The administrative root is the highest-level container in the organization hierarchy. Under this root, you can create organizational units to logically group accounts, and you can organize these organizational units into the hierarchy that can best meet the needs of your business.

### What is an organizational unit?

An organizational unit is a group of Tencent Cloud accounts in an organization. Additional organizational units can also be nested under an organizational unit as long as itâ€™s within the allowed hierarchical limits. For example, you can place all accounts belonging to the same department into a departmental unit. Similarly, you can also group all accounts doing production services into a production unit. When you need to apply the same controls to a group of accounts in the organization, the organizational unit becomes very useful. The nesting of units creates even smaller management units. For example, you can categorize team accounts within a department into different team-level units under the department unit. You can directly specify controls for these team-level units, and they will also inherit policies from their parent units.
