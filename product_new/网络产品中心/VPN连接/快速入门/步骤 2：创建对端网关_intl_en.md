Before creating a VPN tunnel, you need to create a customer gateway.
1. Log in to [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/) and choose **Products** > **Virtual Private Cloud** to access the VPC console.
2. In the left sidebar, choose **VPN Connection** > **Customer Gateway** to go to the management page.
3. Select a region and click **+ New**.
4. Enter the name of the customer gateway (for example, TomVPNUserGw) and the public IP address (for example, `202.108.22.5`) of the VPN gateway of the IDC.
