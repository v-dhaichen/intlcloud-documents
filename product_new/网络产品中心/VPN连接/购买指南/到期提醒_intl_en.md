## Pay-as-you-go VPN Gateways
- **Arrears alerts** 
For pay-as-you-go resources, fees are deducted every hour. When your account balance is negative, the system sends emails and SMS messages to the Tencent Cloud account creator and the global resource and financial collaborators.
- **Arrears processing** 
 - When your account balance becomes negative, your VPN gateway can still be used for two hours with normal fee deduction. Two hours later, your VPN gateway is isolated. 
 - If you recharge your account within 24 hours after your VPN gateway is isolated, it can be used normally with normal fee deduction. 
 - If you do not recharge your account within 24 hours after your VPN gateway is isolated, the system deletes your VPN gateway. All data (including the data of associated VPN tunnels) is cleared and cannot be recovered. 

>
>- When you no longer use pay-as-you-go resources, terminate them as soon as possible to avoid further fee deductions.
>- After an instance is terminated or repossessed, the data is cleared and cannot be recovered.
>- Since your actual resource consumption may change from time to time, there may be a deviation in the balance alert.
