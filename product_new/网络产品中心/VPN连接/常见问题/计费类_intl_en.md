### Why canâ€™t I renew or upgrade VPN gateways?
A VPN gateway cannot be renewed and upgraded at the same time. If you have an unpaid renewal or upgrade order, other renewal or upgrade operations cannot be performed. The system invalidates unpaid renewal or upgrade orders at 24:00 every day, after which you must re-submit your order.
