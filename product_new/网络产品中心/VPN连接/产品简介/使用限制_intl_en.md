## VPN Connections
Pay attention to the following points when you use a VPN connection:
- After VPN parameters are configured, **you need to add routing policies for your VPN gateway in the route table associated with the subnet**, so that access requests from CVMs in the subnet to the customer IP range can reach the customer gateway through the VPN tunnel.
- After the route table is configured, **you need to ping an IP address in the customer IP range from a CVM in the VPC to activate the VPN tunnel.**
- The stability of the VPN connection depends on the performance of the ISPâ€™s public network. Currently, no SLA can be provided.
- The limits on resources are as follows:
<table><tbody>
<tr><th>Resource</th><th>Limit (quantity)</th></tr>
<tr><td>Number of VPN gateways in a VPC</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of customer gateways in a region</td><td>20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of VPN tunnels supported by a customer gateway</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of VPN tunnels that can be created for a VPN gateway</td><td>20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of SPDs for a VPN tunnel</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of customer IP ranges supported by an SPD</td><td>50</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## Customer Gateways
The following IP addresses cannot be used for a customer gateway:
- Multicast addresses that comprise only 0 or only 255, or start with 224.
- Loopback addresses: 127.x.x.x/8.
- IP addresses whose host bits comprise only 0 or 1, for example:
 1. Class-A IP addresses that start with 1-126, such as 1-126.0.0.0 and 1-126.255.255.255.
 2. Class-B IP addresses that start with 128-191, such as 128-191.x.0.0 and 128-191.x.255.255.
 3. Class-C IP addresses that start with 192-223, such as 192-223.x.x.0 and 192-223.x.x.255.
- Internal service addresses: 169.254.x.x/16.
