This document describes NAT billing modes.
## Billing Description
NAT Gateway fees consists of the gateway usage (billed hourly) and the Internet access traffic.
- See **Billing Mode** for gateway fees.
- For detailed traffic fees, see the "Bill-by-traffic" section in [Public Network Billing Methods](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10578).

## Billing Mode
The billing mode for the NAT gateway is as follows:

 >**Notes:**
 >- If the bandwidth package (BWP) feature is activated, fees of the outbound traffic generated by the NAT gateway will be deducted from the BWP (which means the network traffic will not be repeatedly billed). We recommended that you limit the outbound bandwidth of the NAT gateway to avoid high BWP fees. For details, see [Shared Network Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10578).
 >- Arrears measures are the same as pay-as-you-go CVM instances. For details, see [CVM Arrears Reminder](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2181). 
>- NAT Gateway features dual-server hot backup. The system sends a 5KB detection packet to the master and slave servers of NAT Gateway respectively every 3 seconds, so 0.2747GB of traffic will be generated every day.
