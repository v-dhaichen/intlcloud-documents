When your NAT gateway expires, we will provide you with a grace period as follows:
- Starting from the moment your account balance becomes 0, you can use the NAT gateway for a further period of **2** hours with the usage being further billed.
- If your account balance fails to be topped up to an amount greater than 0 after 2 hours, the NAT gateway service is automatically suspended and the billing is stopped.
- The NAT gateway will remain unavailable until your account balance is topped up to an amount greater than 0 within 24 hours after the suspension of the service. When your account balance has been topped up to an amount greater than 0, the gateway will resume and the billing will start again.
- When your account balance has remained below 0 for 24 hours after the suspension of the NAT gateway service, the NAT gateway is repossessed immediately.
- Upon gateway repossessing, the Tencent Cloud account creator and all the collaborators are notified of the repossession via emails and SMS messages.
