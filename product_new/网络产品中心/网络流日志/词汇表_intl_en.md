### Quintuple
A quintuple refers to a collection of five values that comprise a connection, namely the source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and transport layer protocol.
**For example:**
192.168.1.1, 10000, TCP, 121.14.88.76, 80 constitute a Quintuple. In this case, this refers to a terminal with an IP address of 192.168.1.1 and port 10000 that is connecting with a terminal with the IP address of 121.14.88.76 and port 80 using the TCP protocol.
