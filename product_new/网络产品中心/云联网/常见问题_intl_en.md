### How can I start using CCN service?
CCN is currently under beta testing. To use CCN now, please [submit an application](https://cloud.tencent.com/apply/p/tp2478t9skn) and wait for approval. 

### How is CCN billed?
- Intra-region interconnection between CCN instances is free of charge if the bandwidth is less than 1 Gbit/s.
- Cross-region interconnection incurs fees. The actual bandwidth usage in each region in each month is billed according to the monthly 95th percentile standard. For more information, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30053).

### How do I migrate a peering connection or a direct connect to CCN?
You can associate the corresponding network instance with the CCN instance and then implement smooth migration by disabling and re-enabling the related route. For more information, see [Best Practices](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30078).
