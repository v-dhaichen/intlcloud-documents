### Scenario

When initially configuring a CVM, you can configure the security group, and you can also create, view, update, and delete security groups in the console’s security group page, where you can also manage security groups and security group rules. This document describes how to use all security group features in the console.

##  Prerequisites

Log in to the [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index).

## Steps

### Creating a Security Group
> When creating a security group, you can create it by choosing from two templates provided by Tencent Cloud, which are **Open all ports** and **Open ports 22, 80, 443, and 3389 and ICMP protocol to Internet**. You can also create the security group using a custom template.
>
#### Creating Using Tencent Cloud Template
1. In the left sidebar, select **[Security Group](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup)**, and click **+New**.

2. Configure the rule settings in the **Add Inbound/Outbound Rule** pop-up window, and click **Finish**.
The main parameters required when adding a rule are as follows:
 - **Type**: You can select a system rule template or create a custom rule.
 - **Source/destination**: Traffic source (inbound rules) or destination (outbound rules). Choose one of the following options:
    - Specified individual IP address or IP address range: Indicate using CIDR (for example: `203.0.113.0` or `203.0.113.0/24`).
    - Reference a security group ID. You can reference one of the following security group IDs:
      - Current security group. (Indicates the CVM associated with the security group)
      - Other security group. The ID of another security group under the same project in the same region.
    - Reference an IP address object, or an IP address group object in the [Parameter Template].
 - **Protocol port**: Enter the protocol type and port range.<!--or reference a protocol port or protocol port group in the [Parameter Template](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/20090).-->
 - **Policy**: Allow or Reject.

>
>  - Referencing a security group ID is an advanced feature. The rules of the referenced security groups are not added to the current security group.
>  - If you enter the security group ID in Source/Destination when configuring security group rules, the private IP addresses of the CVM instances and the ENIs that are bound with this security group ID are used as Source/Destination. This does not include public IP addresses.

### Modifying a Security Group Rule
> You can modify previously set security group rules based on your actual needs
>
1. Go to the **[Security Group](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup)** management page and select the name/ID of the security group for which rules need to be modified, and click **Modify Rule** on the right side.
