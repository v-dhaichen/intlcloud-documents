Tencent Cloud offers different types of IPs for internet access and private network access. These IPs will not change unless you unbind or change them.

## IPs for Internet Access
A public IP address is an IP address in the Internet that is not reserved. A CVM with a public IP address can access other computers in the Internet and can also be accessed by other computers.
Tencent Cloud offers public IPs and elastic IPs for internet access.

## IPs for Private Network Access
A private IP address is used to implement Tencent Cloud private network services. It cannot be accessed from internet. Each CVM instance has a default network interface assigned with a private IP (i.e. eth0). The private IP address can be automatically assigned by the system. In a VPC environment, the private IP address can also be customized by the user.

### Attributes
- Private network services are user-sensitive. Different users are isolated from each other, which means that the cloud services of the other user cannot be accessed via the private network by default.
- Private network services are region-sensitive. Different regions are isolated from each other, which means that the cloud services under the same account in a different region cannot be accessed via the private network by default.

### Applicable scenarios
The private IP can be used for the communication between CLBs and CVM instances, and between CVM instances and other Tencent Cloud services (such as TencentDB).

### Relevant Operations
- For details on acquiring the private IP address of an instance and setting the DNS, refer to [Acquiring private IP address and setting DNS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/17941).
- For details on modifying the private IPs of CVM instances in a VPC, refer to [Modifying private IP addresses](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16561).
