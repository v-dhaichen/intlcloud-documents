Tencent Cloud has two types of IP addresses, public IP addresses and private IP addresses.

## Public IP Addresses
A public IP address is an IP address in the Internet that is not reserved. A CVM with a public IP address can access other computers in the Internet and can also be accessed by other computers.
Tencent Cloud public IP addresses come in two types, public IPs and EIPs. Both of these can provide CVMs with the ability to access and be accessed by public networks.

## Private IP Addresses
A private IP address is used to implement Tencent Cloud private network services. It cannot be accessed from internet. Each CVM instance has a default network interface assigned with a private IP (i.e. eth0). The private IP address can be automatically assigned by the system. In a VPC environment, the private IP address can also be customized by the user.

### Attributes
- Private network services are user-sensitive. Different users are isolated from each other, which means that the cloud services of the other user cannot be accessed via the private network by default.
- Private network services are region-sensitive. Different regions are isolated from each other, which means that the cloud services under the same account in a different region cannot be accessed via the private network by default.

### Applicable scenarios
The private IP can be used for the communication between CLBs and CVM instances, and between CVM instances and other Tencent Cloud services (such as TencentDB).

### Relevant Operations
- For details on acquiring the private IP address of an instance and setting the DNS, refer to [Acquiring private IP address and setting DNS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/17941).
- For details on modifying the private IPs of CVM instances in a VPC, refer to [Modifying private IP addresses](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16561).
