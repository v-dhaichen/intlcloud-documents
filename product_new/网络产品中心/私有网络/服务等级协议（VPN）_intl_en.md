By clicking "Agree"/ "Next", or by purchasing or using the Service, or by otherwise accepting this Agreement, whether express or implied, you are deemed to have read, and agreed to be bound by, this Agreement. This Agreement shall then have legal effect on both you and Tencent Cloud, constituting a binding legal document on both parties.**

## 1.  Terms and Definitions
1.  **Tencent Cloud** **VPN Connection**: means a network-based tunneling technology provided by Tencent Cloud to you that enables data transfer between customer's local internet data centers and Tencent Cloud resources. For details, please refer to the Service you purchase, and the contents of the Service provided by Tencent Cloud.
    
2.  **Single VPN Gateway Instance**: means one (1) VPN gateway instance. The Service Availability will be calculated on a Single VPN Gateway Instance basis.
    
3.  **Service Month(s) of a Single VPN Gateway Instance**: means the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you. For example, if you purchase the Service for a term of three months starting from March 17, there will be four (4) Service Months (the first Service Month from March 17 to March 31, the second from April 1 to April 30, the third from May 1 to May 31, and the fourth from June 1 to June 16). The availability of the Service will be calculated independently for each Service Month.
    
4.  **Total Time of a Single VPN Gateway Instance within a Service Month**: the total number of days of the Service Month × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes).
    
5.  **Single VPN Gateway Instance Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes**: If (and only if) all your continuous attempts to connect a specific Single VPN Gateway Instance fail within one (1) minute, it shall be deemed that the Service with respect to such instance is unavailable within such one (1) minute. If the continuous attempts that have failed last less than one (1) minute, such period will not be counted into the Service downtime. The accumulated Service downtime so calculated in minutes of a Single VPN Gateway Instance within a Service Month is the Single VPN Gateway Instance Service Downtime for such Service Month.
    
6.  **Monthly Service Fee**: means the aggregate service fees paid by you for a Single VPN Gateway Instance within one (1) Service Month, excluding the portion paid yet to be consumed, and the portion deducted by a voucher or promotional coupon, due to discounted service fee or otherwise deducted.
    
## 2.  Service Availability

**2.1	Calculation of Service Availability**

Service Availability = (Total Time of a Single VPN Gateway Instance within a Service Month - Single VPN Gateway Instance Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes) / Total Time of a Single VPN Gateway Instance within a Service Month × 100%

**2.2	Service Availability Standard**
The Service Availability of the Service will be no less than 99.95%. You are entitled to the compensation as set forth in Section 3 below if the Service Availability fails to meet the aforementioned standard, other than in any circumstance as provided for in the release of liabilities provisions below. 
Assuming that a Service Month has thirty (30) days, the total available time of a Single VPN Gateway Instance in such month would be 30 (days) × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes) × 99.95% = 43,178.4 minutes; that is, the Service downtime of the instance in such month will be 43,200 – 43,178.4 = 21.6 minutes.


## 3.  Service Compensation

In respect of this Service, if the Service Availability fails to meet the abovementioned standard, you will be entitled to compensations in accordance with the following terms:

**3.1	Standards of Compensation**
(1) Compensations will be made **in the form of voucher** by Tencent Cloud, and you should follow the rules for using the voucher (including the valid term; for details, please refer to the rules of vouchers published on Tencent Cloud’s official website). You cannot redeem such voucher for cash or request to issue an invoice for such voucher. Such voucher can only be used to purchase the Service by using your Tencent Cloud account. You cannot use the voucher to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the voucher to a third party for consideration or for free.
(2) If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the standard, the amount of compensation will be calculated for such month independently, and **the aggregate amount shall be no more than the applicable Monthly Service Fee paid by you for such month** (the Monthly Service Fee referred to herein shall exclude the portion deducted by a voucher or promotional coupon, due to discounted service fee or otherwise deducted). 

|**Service Availability (Av) for a Service Month**|	**Value of Compensation Voucher**|
|-|-|
|99.95% > Av ≥ 99%|	10% of the Monthly Service Fee|
|99% > Av ≥ 95%	|25% of the Monthly Service Fee|
|95% > Av|	100% of the Monthly Service Fee|


3.2 **Time Limit for Compensation Application**

(1) If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the abovementioned Service Availability standard, you may apply for compensation **through (and only through) the support ticket system under your relevant account** after the fifth (5^th^) business day of the month immediately following such Service Month. Tencent Cloud will verify and ascertain your application upon receipt of such application. If there is any dispute over the calculation of the Service Availability for a Service Month, **both parties agree that the back-end record of Tencent Cloud will prevail**.

(2) **You should apply for such compensation no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the expiry of the applicable Service Month in which the Service Availability fails to meet the standard**. If you fail to make any application within such period, or make the application after such period, or make the application by any means other than that agreed herein, it shall be deemed that you have voluntarily waived your right to apply for such compensation and any other rights you may have against Tencent Cloud, in which case Tencent Cloud has the right to reject your application for compensation and not to make any compensation to you.

## 4.  Release of Liabilities

**If the Service is unavailable due to any of the following reasons, the corresponding Service downtime shall not be counted towards Service unavailability period, and is not eligible for compensation by Tencent Cloud, and Tencent Cloud will not be held liable to you:**
