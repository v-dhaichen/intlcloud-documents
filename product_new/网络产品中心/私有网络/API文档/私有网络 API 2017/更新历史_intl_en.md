Notes:

`API version` is only used for the upgraded APIs and it must be specified for each upgraded API. The upgraded APIs were first launched with the version number of `2017-03-12`. Generally, an API will be modified in a way that is compatible with the previous versions. In such case, the version number remains the same. A new version number, which is used to differentiate requests and ensure backward compatibility, is released only when there is a major change or the changes make the new version incompatible with previous versions.
