The Tencent Cloud Virtual Machine is operated in the Tencent IDC, and provides the auto-scaling computing, storage and network service. The software system can be built and hosted according to business needs. Users can not only use the console to manage CVM, but use APIs to create, terminate, and restart the CVM, as well as modifying its bandwidth. For API details, see:

- [Cloud Virtual Machine API (Old Version)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/568)

> The CVM APIs are updated, as we recommended to use them. The old APIs still work. For those who use the old APIs, please refer to Cloud Virtual Machine API (Old Version).
