Both cross-region and cross-account communication of VPCs are advanced features of peering connections. This document describes how to implement **cross-region** communication by using an example.
## Example
- IP range 1: subnet A `192.168.1.0/24` of VPC1 in **Guangzhou**.
- IP range 2: subnet B `10.0.1.0/24` of VPC2 in **Beijing**.

Perform the two steps below to implement communication between IP ranges 1 and 2 over a peering connection under the same account:

## Step 1: create a peering connection
1. Log in to [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/) and choose **Products** > **Networking** > **Virtual Private Cloud** to access the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) console.
2. In the left sidebar, click **Peering Connections** to go to the management page.
3. Select a region and a VPC (for example, Guangzhou and `VPC1`) above the list and then click **New** to create a peering connection.
4. Enter a name (for example, PeerConn), select the local region and network, and select the peer region (for example, Beijing), account type, and VPC. Then, accept the service agreement.
 - If the peer account type is **My Account**, select the account from the drop-down list.
 - If the peer account type is **Other Accounts**, enter the account ID and VPC ID of the peer account.

5. Select the bandwidth cap.
 - For an intra-region peering connection, there is no bandwidth cap. Therefore, this **cannot be modified**.
 - For a cross-region peering connection, the bandwidth cap can be selected. If you need higher cross-region bandwidth, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
6. Click **Create**. A peering connection between two VPCs under the same account takes effect immediately after its creation.


## Step 2: set route tables at both ends
1. Log in to [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/) and choose **Products** > **Networking** > **Virtual Private Cloud** to access the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) console.
2. In the left sidebar, click **Subnet** to go to the management page.
3. Click the ID of the route table (route table A) associated with the local subnet (subnet A) of the peering connection to access the route table details page.
4. Click **+ New routing policies**.
5. Enter the peer CIDR (`10.0.1.0/24`) for the destination, select **Peering Connections** for the next hop type, and select the created peering connection (PeerConn) for the next hop.

6. Click **OK**. After the route table is configured, communication is enabled between the IP ranges of the two VPCs.
**The peer route table is configured in the same way as that at the local end.**

>**Notes:**
>- You must configure routes at both ends before you can communicate via the peering connection.
>- To enable communication between multiple IP ranges of the two VPCs at both ends, you simply need to **add the corresponding route table entries**, but not create multiple peering connections.
