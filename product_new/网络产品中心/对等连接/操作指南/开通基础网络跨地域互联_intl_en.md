Currently, cross-region Classiclink supports only communication between CVMs, but does not support communication between a CVM and other Tencent Cloud resource (such as a database). 
A VPC is strongly recommended for cross-region conmmunication. If you still need to use cross-region Classiclink, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category/create?).
