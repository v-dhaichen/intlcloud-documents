When you create a cross-account peering connection or a shared direct connect, you need to enter the account ID of the peer developer, which you can check as follows:
1. Log in to [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com), and click the account name in the upper-right corner.
2. Click **Account Information** to view the account ID on the details page.
