**Please do not purchase the Service unless and until you have fully read, and completely understood and accepted all the terms hereof. By clicking "Agree"/ "Next", or by purchasing or using the Service, or by otherwise accepting this Agreement, whether express or implied, you are deemed to have read, and agreed to be bound by, this Agreement. This Agreement shall then have legal effect on both you and Tencent Cloud, constituting a binding legal document on both parties.**

## 1.  Terms and Definitions

1.1  **Cloud** **Load Balancer (CLB)**: means a traffic distribution service provided by Tencent Cloud to expand the system's service capacity and to eliminate single node malfunction by load balancer. For details, please refer to the Service you purchase, and the contents of the Service provided by Tencent Cloud.

1.2  **Single Instance**: means one (1) CLB instance. The Service Availability will be calculated on a Single Instance basis.

1.3  **Total Time of a Single Instance within a Service Month**: equals to the total number of days of the Service Month × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes).

1.4  **Instance Unavailability**: If all the attempted connection with a CLB instance with incoming and outgoing permission rules fails, and such status lasts for more than one (1) minute, it will be deemed that the CLB instance is unavailable within such one (1) minute.

1.5  **Single Instance Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes**: Single Instance Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes = the time when the Instance Unavailability is fixed -- the time when the Instance Unavailability starts. Such downtime will be calculated in minutes, and when the downtime, or a portion thereof, is less than sixty (60) seconds, it will be rounded up to one (1) minute. For example, if the actual downtime of a Single Instance is one (1) minute and one (1) second, the Single Instance Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes would be two (2) minutes. However, when the Instance Unavailability is fixed within one (1) minute, which means that the actual downtime of the Service is less than one (1) minute, such downtime will not be counted in the Service downtime defined herein.

1.6  **Single Instance Service Downtime within a Service Month**: means the sum of the Single Instance Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes within a Service Month.

1.7  **Service Month(s)**: means the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you. For example, if you purchase the Service for a term of three months starting from March 17, there will be four (4) Service Months (the first Service Month from March 17 to March 31, the second from April 1 to April 30, the third from May 1 to May 31, and the fourth from June 1 to June 16). The availability of the Service will be calculated independently for each Service Month.

1.8.  **Monthly Service Fee**: means the aggregate service fees paid by you for a Single CLB Instance within one (1) Service Month, excluding the portion paid yet to be consumed, and the portion deducted by a voucher or promotional voucher, due to discounted service fee or otherwise deducted.

## 2.  Service Availability

2.1  **Calculation of Service Availability**

Service Availability = (total time of a Single Instance within a Service Month calculated in minutes - Single Instance Service Downtime within a Service Month) / total time of a Single Instance within a Service Month calculated in minutes × 100%

2.2  **Service Availability**

**The Service Availability of the Service provided by Tencent Cloud will be** **no less than 99.95%**. You are entitled to the compensation as set forth in Section 3 below if the Service Availability fails to meet the aforementioned standard, other than in any circumstance as provided for in the release of liabilities provisions below.

*If a Service Month has thirty (30) days, the total available time of a Single Instance in such month would be 30 (days) × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes) × 99.95% = 43178.4 minutes; that is, the Service downtime of the instance in such month will be 43200 -- 43178.4 = 21.6 minutes.*

## 3.  Service Compensation

In respect of this Service, if the Service Availability fails to meet the abovementioned standard, you will be entitled to compensations in accordance with the following terms:

3.1  **Standards of Compensation**

(1) Compensations will be made **in the form of voucher** by Tencent Cloud, and you should follow the rules for using the voucher (including the valid term; for details, please refer to the rules of vouchers published on Tencent Cloud's official website). You cannot redeem such voucher for cash or request to issue an invoice for such voucher. Such voucher can only be used to purchase the Service by using your Tencent Cloud account. You cannot use the voucher to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the voucher to a third party for consideration or for free.

(2) If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the standard, the amount of compensation will be calculated for such month independently, and **the aggregate amount shall be no more than the applicable Monthly Service Fee paid by you for such month** (the Monthly Service Fee referred to herein shall exclude the portion deducted by a voucher or promotional credit, due to discounted service fee or otherwise deducted).

|**Service Availability (Av) for a Service Month**|   **Value of Compensation Voucher**|
|-|-|
|99.95% \> Av ≥ 99%|                                  10% of the Monthly Service Fee|
|99% \> Av ≥ 95%|                                     25% of the Monthly Service Fee|
|95% \> Av|                                           100% of the Monthly Service Fee|

3.2  **Time Limit for Compensation Application**

(1) If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the abovementioned Service Availability standard, you may apply for compensation **through (and only through) the support ticket system under your relevant account** after the fifth (5^th^) business day of the month immediately following such Service Month. Tencent Cloud will verify and ascertain your application upon receipt of such application. If there is any dispute over the calculation of the Service Availability for a Service Month, **both parties agree that the back-end record of Tencent Cloud will prevail**.

(2) **You should apply for such compensation no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the expiry of the applicable Service Month in which the Service Availability fails to meet the standard**. If you fail to make any application within such period, or make the application after such period, or make the application by any means other than that agreed herein, it shall be deemed that you have voluntarily waived your right to apply for such compensation and any other rights you may have against Tencent Cloud, in which case Tencent Cloud has the right to reject your application for compensation and not to make any compensation to you.
