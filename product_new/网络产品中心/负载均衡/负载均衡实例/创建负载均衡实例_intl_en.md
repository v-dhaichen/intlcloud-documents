Tencent Cloud allows you to create a CLB instance on the official purchase page or via API. The two methods are detailed below:

### Creating a CLB instance on the official purchase page
You can purchase a CLB instance on [Tencent Cloud official website](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/lb). Private network CLB is free of charge, while public network CLB only charges instance fees on an hourly pay-as-you-go basis. You can purchase public network on [CVM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/495). For more information on network billing modes, please see [Public Network Billing Mode](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10578).

You can purchase a CLB instance on the official website as follows:
1. Log into Tencent Cloud official website and go to [CLB purchase page](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/lb).
2. Select "CLB" (recommended) as the instance type.
3. Select attributes as needed, such as network and project to which the instance belongs. For more information on attributes, please see [Product Attribute Selection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/13629).
4. Complete payment after confirming the purchase.
5. CLB service is enabled after the payment completes. You can now configure and use the CLB instance.
