Dear Tencent Cloud User,
For a better product experience, we are going to rename the instance type "Application Load Balancer" to "Cloud Load Balancer (CLB)‚Äù.

| Original Name | New Name | Instance Type Description |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Application Load Balancer | Cloud Load Balancer | A major instance type which covers all features of Classic CLB <li>TCP/UDP/HTTP/HTTPS protocols are supported </li><li>Flexible forwarding capabilities based on domain name and URL path are provided</li> |
| Classic CLB | Classic CLB | Classic CLB <li>configuration is simple</li><li>Private network CLB does not support HTTP/HTTPS protocols</li> |

For detailed feature comparisons between the two instance types, see [CLB Comparison](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/8847).

>
> 1. The name change does not affect CLB configuration, billing, or other rules. The original name will be specified in parentheses within > >two months after name change, and only the new name will be used after that.
> 2. We apologize for any inconvenience caused. If you have any questions, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category). Thank you for your support.
