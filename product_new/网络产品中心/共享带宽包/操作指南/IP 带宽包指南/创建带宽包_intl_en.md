>- To use IP bandwidth packages, device bandwidth package users can [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to change the account type to “bill by traffic on IP”.

1. Log in to the [Virtual Private Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/vpc?rid=1).
2. Click **Bandwidth Package** on the left sidebar.
3. Select a region, and click **+ New** in the upper-left corner.
4. In the pop-up window, enter a name, select a billing mode, and click **OK**.
5. After the bandwidth package is created, we recommend that you set a bandwidth cap for the resources in the bandwidth package. For example, you can perform the following operations:
 - To set a bandwidth cap for an EIP:
    1. Log in to the [EIP Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/instance/index?rid=1).
    2. In the Operation column, choose **More** -> **Resource Adjustment** -> **Adjust Network** to set the bandwidth cap. 
 - To set a bandwidth cap for CLB:
    1. Log in to the [Cloud Load Balancer Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/clb/index?rid=1&type=2%2C3).
    2. In the Operation column, choose **More** -> **Adjust Bandwidth** to set the bandwidth cap.
