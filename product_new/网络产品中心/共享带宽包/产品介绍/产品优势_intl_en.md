### Reduced Costs
BWP can help you achieve peak bandwidth shifting, so that when the traffic peaks of different businesses accessing the Internet occur at different times, the traffic can be billed in a multi-IP aggregated manner to reduce the costs of Internet access.

### Flexible Billing
BWP offers various billing methods such as prepaid traffic, billing based on top 5 monthly peaks and billing based on the 95th monthly peak, enabling you to choose the Internet access billing option most appropriate for your business scenario needs.

### Ease of Management
If you have a large number of services that require Internet access, the service devices can be added to BWP in batches for centralized management. In addition, multiple BWPs can be activated for one single account with each BWP independently charged and flexibly managed.

### Transparent Usage
The data usage of BWP and all devices in it can be displayed in real time at all granularities, enabling you to get accurate bandwidth usage readings at any time, quickly identify the network devices with abnormal bandwidth usage and reduce the risk of exceeding budget.

### Itemized Billing
BWP bills are itemized by resource, helping you accurately quantify the bandwidth resources consumed by each project and easily calculate project costs.
