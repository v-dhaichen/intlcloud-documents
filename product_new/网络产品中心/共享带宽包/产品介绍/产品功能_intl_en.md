Tencent Cloud Bandwidth Package (BWP) can greatly reduce your Internet access costs through the following features:
## Multi-IP Aggregated Billing 
BWP makes it possible to bill the bandwidth of multiple IP addresses at the same time in an aggregated manner, so that the bandwidth of all devices in the entire region can be aggregated into a total bandwidth for billing.
## Multiple Billing Methods
BWP offers various billing methods such as prepaid traffic, billing based on top 5 monthly peaks, and 95th percentile charging.
## Central Device Management 
After a large number of devices are added to BWP, only the upper bandwidth limit and billing method of BWP need to be managed.
## Monitoring Data at Various Granularities
BWP can display usage data by each package and at multiple levels in the package such as minute, hour, and day.
## Itemized Billing 
BWP bills are itemized by resource. In this way, total costs are broken down into various items based on the bandwidth resource usage by each item.
