## Introduction
This document describes how to delete roles. After being deleted, a role will no longer have the permissions to manage the resources under the root account.

## Directions
1. Log in to the CAM Console and go to the [Roles](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/role) page.
2. In the Roles page, select the role you want to delete.
3. Click **Delete** in the operation column and click **OK** to complete the deletion.
> Once a role is deleted, the authorization information associated with the role will also be deleted. Click **OK** to delete the role. The entity of the role, whether it is an account or a service, will no longer be able to use it.
