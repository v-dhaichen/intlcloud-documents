## Introduction
This document describes how to set sub-user login password rules to regulate sub-usersâ€™ login password character types, length, and validity period.

## Directions
> 
> - The password rules set here only apply to sub-users that use passwords to log in. Collaborators and sub-users that use WeChat Work to log in are not subject to these rules.
> - After the login password expires, sub-users will not be able to log in with alternative login methods and must reset the password.

1. Log in to the CAM console and select **Users** > **[User Settings](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/security/subAccount)** on the left sidebar.
2. Set the password rules.

<table>
<tr><th "width:20%;">Rules</th "width:40%;"><th>Options</th><th>Restrictions</th></tr>
<tr><td>Character type</td><td>Select the characters that must be used in the password. You can choose numeric characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters (except for spaces)</td><td> At least one item must be selected
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Length</td><td>Restrict the minimum password length</td><td>  
  The length can be set between 8 - 32 characters
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Validity period</td><td> Restrict the password validity period. When the password expires, it must be reset</td><td>   
The period can be set between 0 - 365 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>Duplication restrictions</td><td>Restrict the usage of old passwords</td><td>    
  Between 0 - 24 recent passwords can be restricted from being reused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Retry restrictions</td><td>Restricts the number of times that the wrong password can be entered. If number of times the wrong password is entered exceeds the limit set, the login will automatically be locked for 1 hour</td><td>  
This can be set for between 0 - 10 times/hour</td></tr>
</table>

3. Click **Apply Changes** to set the configured password rules. You can set the password of a sub-user according to the new rules. When sub-users reset passwords, they must do so according to the password rules you have set.
> For the security of your account, sub-users will not be prompted of these rules when they reset passwords. You can go to [User Settings](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/security/subAccount) to download the current password rules and send them to the users as needed.
