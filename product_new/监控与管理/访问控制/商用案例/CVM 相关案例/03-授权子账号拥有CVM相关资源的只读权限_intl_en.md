The enterprise account, CompanyExample (ownerUin: 12345678), has a sub-account, Developer, that requires query permission for CVM instances and related resources (VPC, CLB) for the CVM service under the CompanyExample enterprise account. The sub-account is not allowed to create, delete, or start up/shut down CVM instances.

Solution A:

The enterprise account, CompanyExample, associates the Developer sub-account with the preset policy QcloudCVMReadOnlyAccess. To learn how to associate a policy with a user account, see [Authorization Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10602).

Solution B:

Step 1: create the following policy by using policy syntax.
```
{
    "version": "2.0",
    "statement": [
        {
            "action": [
                "cvm:Describe*",
                "cvm:Inquiry*"
            ],
            "resource": "*",
            "effect": "allow"
        },
        {
            "action": [
                "vpc:Describe*",
                "vpc:Inquiry*",
                "vpc:Get*"
            ],
            "resource": "*",
            "effect": "allow"
        },
        {
            "action": [
                "clb:Describe*"
            ],
            "resource": "*",
            "effect": "allow"
        },
        {
            "effect": "allow",
            "action": "monitor:*",
            "resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
Step 2: associate the sub-account with the policy. To learn how to associate a policy with a user account, see [Authorization Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10602).
