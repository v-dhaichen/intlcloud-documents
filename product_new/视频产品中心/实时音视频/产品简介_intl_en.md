## Benefits

#### Low latency
TRTC offers a highly connected, reliable, and secure network across the globe. Leveraging our proprietary multi-addressing algorithms, TRTC has the ability to stream users' audio/video data to optimal nodes across the entire network. When a user logs in outside Mainland China, TRTC SDK connects the user to the nearest access point or edge server. With abundant high-bandwidth resources and globally-distributed edge servers, it can ensure **an average end-to-end latency of below 300 ms ** between countries/regions.

#### Low lag
TRTC reduces lags through intelligent QoS and optimized encoding, and is resilient against **a packet loss rate of over 40%** and **network jitter of over 1,000 ms*. Even with poor network condition, it can ensure a high-quality and stable audio/video communication.

#### High quality
TRTC **eliminates echoes and howling to deliver lossless audio quality, with a FHD video quality of up to 1920Ã—1080**. Powered by Tencent Cloud's video processing algorithms and TBS's high compatibility based on X5 Blink kernel, TRTC enhances video definition and reduces mosaics, providing users on HTML5 webpages with an experience comparable to that on native apps.

#### Compatibility with multiple platforms
TRTC supports more than 5,000 types of devices on a wide range of platforms. With TRTC, you can initiate, receive, or disconnect from audio/video calls through HTML5 pages or Mini Programs on WeChat, mobile QQ, or QQ Browser. It also supports audio/video calls through web pages or SDK-integrated apps on PC, Mac, and mobile phones.
