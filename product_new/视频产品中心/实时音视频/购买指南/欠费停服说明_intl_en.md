# Notes for Arrears Processing

When the Tencent Cloud billing platform detects that your Tencent Cloud account balance is insufficient, it will send you reminders for top-up. You have 24 hours to top up after your account falls into arrears. If you fail to do so, the TRTC service will be suspended. If you top up your account within 24 hours of arrears, your TRTC service will not be affected. Please kindly note that after the service is suspended, users will not be able to enter rooms.
