## Creating and Terminating an ITRTCCloud Singleton

### getTRTCShareInstance

This API is used to get [ITRTCCloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35132#itrtccloud) object pointer in dynamic DLL loading.
```
LITEAV_API ITRTCCloud * getTRTCShareInstance()
```

__Return__

The pointer of the [ITRTCCloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35132#itrtccloud) singleton object will be returned. Note: deleting `ITRTCCloud*` will cause a compilation error; therefore, `destroyTRTCCloud` needs to be called to release the singleton pointer object.


### destroyTRTCShareInstance

This API is used to release [ITRTCCloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35132#itrtccloud) singleton object.
```
LITEAV_API void destroyTRTCShareInstance()
```



## Setting the `ITRTCCloudCallback` Callback
### addCallback

This API is used to set the [ITRTCCloudCallback](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35133) callback API.
```
void addCallback(ITRTCCloudCallback * callback)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| callback | [ITRTCCloudCallback](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35133) * | Event callback pointer. |

__Overview__

You can use [ITRTCCloudCallback](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35133) to get various status notifications from the SDK. For more information, please see the definitions in `ITRTCCloudCallback.h`.


### removeCallback

This API is used to remove event callback.
```
void removeCallback(ITRTCCloudCallback * callback)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| callback | [ITRTCCloudCallback](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35133) * | Event callback pointer. |



## Room API Functions
### enterRoom

This API is used to enter room.
```
void enterRoom(const TRTCParams & params, TRTCAppScene scene)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| params | const [TRTCParams](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35134#trtcparams) & | Room entry parameters. For more information, please see [TRTCParams](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35134#trtcparams). |
| scene | [TRTCAppScene](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35134#trtcappscene) | Application scenario. Currently, only video call (`VideoCall`) and LVB (`Live) scenarios are supported. |

__Overview__

If the room is successfully entered, the `onEnterRoom()` callback will be received; otherwise, the `onEnterRoom(result)` callback will be received. For more information on error codes for room entry failures, please see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35135).

>?No matter whether room entry is successful, `enterRoom` must be used together with `exitRoom`. If `enterRoom` is called again before `exitRoom` is called, an unexpected error will occur.



### exitRoom

This API is used to exit room.
```
void exitRoom()
```

__Overview__

When the [exitRoom()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35132#exitroom) API is called, the logic related to room exit will be executed, such as releasing resources of audio/video devices and codecs. After resources are released, the SDK will use the `onExitRoom()` callback in `TRTCCloudCallback` to notify you.
If you need to call [enterRoom()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35132#enterroom) again or switch to another audio/video SDK, please wait until you receive the `onExitRoom()` callback; otherwise, exceptions such as occupied camera or mic may occur.


### switchRole

This API is used to switch roles and applies only to the LVB scenario (`TRTCAppSceneLIVE`).
```
void switchRole(TRTCRoleType role)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| role | [TRTCRoleType](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35134#trtcroletype) | Target role, which is anchor by default. |

__Overview__

In the LVB scenario, a user may need to switch between "viewer" and "anchor" roles. You can use the `role` field in [TRTCParams](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35134#trtcparams) before room entry to determine the role or use the `switchRole` API to switch roles after room entry.


### connectOtherRoom

This API is used to request cross-room call (anchor competition).
```
void connectOtherRoom(const char * params)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| params | const char * | Co-anchoring parameters in the format of JSON string. `roomId` indicates the target room number, and `userId` indicates the target user ID. |

__Overview__

In TRTC, two anchors in different rooms can use the "cross-room call" feature to co-anchor across the rooms. They can engage in "co-anchoring competition" without the need to exit their own rooms.
For example, when anchor A in room "001" uses [connectOtherRoom()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35132#connectotherroom) to successfully call anchor B in room "002", all users in room "001" will receive the `onUserEnter(B)` and `onUserVideoAvailable(B,true)` callbacks of anchor B, and all users in room "002" will receive the `onUserEnter(A)` and `onUserVideoAvailable(A,true)` callbacks of anchor A.
In short, cross-room call is to share between two anchors in different rooms, so that users in either room can see both of them.

<pre>
               Room 001                    Room 002
            --------------              -------------
 Before cross-room call: | Anchor A      |             | Anchor B     |
            | Viewers U, V, and W  |             | Viewers X, Y, and Z |
            --------------              -------------</pre>



<pre>              Room 001                     Room 002
            --------------              -------------
 After cross-room call: | Anchors A and B    |             | Anchors B and A   |
            | Viewers U, V, and W  |             | Viewers X, Y, and Z |
            --------------              -------------
</pre>

For the sake of compatibility of subsequent extended fields for cross-room call, parameters in JSON format are used currently and must contain at least two fields:
- `roomId`: If anchor A in room "001" wants to co-anchor with anchor B in room "002", the `roomId` must be set to `002` when anchor A calls [connectOtherRoom()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35132#connectotherroom).
- `userId`: If anchor A in room "001" wants to co-anchor with anchor B in room "002", the `userId` must be set to the `userId` of anchor B when anchor A calls [connectOtherRoom()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35132#connectotherroom).


The result of requesting cross-room call will be returned through the `onConnectOtherRoom()` callback in `TRTCCloudCallback`.


<pre>
  //Here, the JsonCpp library is used to format the JSON string
  Json::Value jsonObj;
  jsonObj["roomId"] = 002;
  jsonObj["userId"] = "userB";
  Json::FastWriter writer;
  std::string params = writer.write(jsonObj);
  trtc.ConnectOtherRoom(params.c_str());
</pre>


### disconnectOtherRoom

This API is used to exit cross-room co-anchoring.
```
void disconnectOtherRoom()
```

__Overview__

The result of exiting cross-room call will be returned through the `onDisconnectOtherRoom()` callback in `TRTCCloudCallback`.


### setDefaultStreamRecvMode

This API is used to set audio/video data reception mode, which must be set before room entry for it to take effect.
```
void setDefaultStreamRecvMode(bool autoRecvAudio, bool autoRecvVideo)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| autoRecvAudio | bool | true: audio data will be automatically received; false: `muteRemoteAudio` needs to be called to send or cancel a request. Default value: true. |
| autoRecvVideo | bool | true: video data will be automatically received; false: `startRemoteView/stopRemoteView` needs to be called to send or cancel a request. Default value: true. |

__Overview__

To deliver an excellent instant broadcasting experience, the SDK automatically receives audio/video upon successful room entry by default, that is, you will immediately receive audio/video data from all remote users. If you do not call `startRemoteView`, video data will be automatically canceled due to timeout. If you use this API mainly in scenarios where automatic video data reception is not required, such as audio chat, you can select the reception mode based on your actual needs.

>?This API takes effect only if it is set before room entry.

## Audio API Functions
### startLocalAudio

This API is used to enable local audio capture and upstreaming.
```
void startLocalAudio()
```

__Overview__

This function will start mic capture and transmit audio data to other users in the room. The SDK does not enable local audio upstreaming by default, which means that if you do not call this function, other users in the room will not hear your voice.

>?The TRTC SDK does not enable local mic capture by default.



### stopLocalAudio

This API is used to disable local audio capture and upstreaming.
```
void stopLocalAudio()
```

__Overview__

When local audio capture and upstreaming is disabled, other members in the room will receive the `onUserAudioAvailable(false)` callback notification.


### muteLocalAudio

This API is used to mute local audio.
```
void muteLocalAudio(bool mute)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| mute | bool | true: blocks; false: enables. Default value: false. |

__Overview__

After local audio is muted, other members in the room will receive the `onUserAudioAvailable(false)` callback notification. Different from `stopLocalAudio`, `muteLocalAudio` will not stop sending audio/video data; instead, it continues to send mute packets of an extremely low bitrate. `muteLocalAudio` is ideal in scenarios where the requirement for recording quality is high, so as to record MP4 files with better compatibility. This is because that some video file formats such as MP4 have a high requirement for audio continuity, an MP4 recording file cannot be played back smoothly if `stopLocalAudio` is used.


### muteRemoteAudio

This API is used to mute the specified user's audio.
```
void muteRemoteAudio(const char * userId, bool mute)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |

__Overview__

After this feature is enabled, the SDK will return the evaluation of the voice volume level of each channel in `onUserVoiceVolume()`. The volume bar in the demo is implemented based on this API. To enable this feature, call this API before calling [startLocalAudio()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35132#startlocalaudio).


### startAudioRecording

This API is used to start audio recording.
```

| iconSize | const SIZE & | Specifies icon size of the window to be obtained. |

__Return__

List of windows (including the screen).

__Overview__

If you want to add the screen sharing feature to your application, a window selection UI needs to be displayed first generally, so that the user can select the window to be shared. You can use the related functions to get the ID, type, name, and thumbnail of shareable windows and implement the window selection UI with the obtained information. Or, you can use the UI implemented in the demo's source code.

>?The returned list includes the screen and application windows. The screen will be in the first several elements in the list.
>If deleting the `ITRTCScreenCaptureSourceList*` pointer causes a compilation error, the SDK will maintain the lifecycle of the `ITRTCScreenCaptureSourceList` object.


### selectScreenCaptureTarget

| captureRect | const RECT & | Specifies the area to be captured. |
| captureMouse | bool | Specifies whether to capture mouse cursor. |
| highlightWindow | bool | Specifies whether to highlight the currently shared window and whether to highlight a covered window to remind the user to move the covering window away. |

__Overview__

If you want to switch to another window to be shared during screen sharing, you can call this function again with no need to start screen sharing again.
The following sharing modes are supported:
- Sharing the entire screen: for `source` whose `type` is `Screen` in `sourceInfoList`, set `captureRect` to `{ 0, 0, 0, 0 }`.

For more information, please see the definition of [TRTCVideoEncParam](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35134#trtcvideoencparam) in `TRTCCloudDef.h`. |

__Overview__

Different from [setVideoEncoderParam()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35132#setvideoencoderparam) that is used to set the encoding quality of the image of the primary channel, this function is only used to set codec parameters for the image of the secondary channel (e.g., screen sharing and remote video playback). These settings determine the quality of image viewed by remote users, which is also the image quality of recorded video files in the cloud.


### setSubStreamMixVolume

This API is used to set audio mixing volume level of the secondary stream.
```
void setSubStreamMixVolume(uint32_t volume)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| volume | uint32_t | Volume level of audio mixing. Value range: 0–100. |

__Overview__

The greater the value, the larger the ratio of the secondary stream volume level to the mic volume level. It is not recommended to set a high value for this parameter as a high volume level will cover the mic sound.



## Custom Capture and Rendering API Functions
### enableCustomVideoCapture

This API is used to enable custom video capture mode.
```
void enableCustomVideoCapture(bool enable)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| enable | bool | Whether to enable. Default value: false. |

__Overview__

After the custom mode is enabled, the SDK will not run the original video capture process and retain only the encoding and sending capabilities. You need to use [sendCustomVideoData()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35132#sendcustomvideodata) to continuously insert the captured video image into the SDK.


### sendCustomVideoData

This API is used to deliver the captured video data to the SDK.
```
void sendCustomVideoData(TRTCVideoFrame * frame)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| frame | TRTCVideoFrame * | Video data. The I420 format is supported. |

__Overview__

It is recommended to enter the following information for `TRTCVideoFrame` (other fields can be left empty):
- pixelFormat: only `LiteAVVideoPixelFormat_I420` is supported.
- bufferType: only `LiteAVVideoBufferType_Buffer` is supported.
- data: video frame buffer.
- length: data length of a video frame. Its value in I420 format is `width * height * 3 / 2`.
- width: video image length.
- height: video image width.
- timestamp: if the intervals for `timestamp` are uneven, the audio/video sync and quality of MP4 recording will be seriously affected.


For more information, please see [Custom Capture and Rendering](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35158).

>?
>- The SDK has an internal frame rate control logic, and the target frame rate set in `setVideoEncoderParam` shall prevail. If the frame rate is too high, automatic frame discarding may occur; if too low, automatic frame interpolation will be implemented.
>- It is recommended to set `timestamp` in `frame` to 0, so that the SDK will set the timestamp by itself. However, please "evenly" set the calling interval of `sendCustomVideoData`; otherwise, the video frame rate will be unstable.


### enableCustomAudioCapture

This API is used to enable the custom audio capture mode. After this mode is enabled, the SDK will not run the original audio capture process and retain only the encoding and sending capabilities. You need to use [sendCustomAudioData()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35132#sendcustomaudiodata) to continuously insert the captured audio data into the SDK.
```
void enableCustomAudioCapture(bool enable)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| enable | bool | Whether to enable. Default value: false. |


### sendCustomAudioData

This API is used to deliver the captured audio data to the SDK.
```
void sendCustomAudioData(TRTCAudioFrame * frame)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| frame | TRTCAudioFrame * | Audio frame. Currently, only mono channel, 48 kHz sample rate, and the `LiteAVAudioFrameFormatPCM` format are supported. |

__Overview__

It is recommended to enter the following information for `TRTCAudioFrame` (other fields can be left empty):
- audioFormat: only `LiteAVAudioFrameFormatPCM` is supported.
- data: audio frame buffer.
- length: audio frame data length. It is recommended to set sampling time to 20 ms for each frame. **For example, if the PCM format is used and the sample rate is 48000, then the frame length for mono channel will be `48000 * 0.02s * 1 * 16 bit = 15360 bit = 1920 bytes`.**
- sampleRate: sample rate. Currently, only 48000 is supported.
- channel: number of channels (if stereo is used, data is interwoven). Valid values: 1: mono channel; 2: dual channel.
- timestamp: if the intervals for `timestamp` are uneven, the audio/video sync and quality of MP4 recording will be seriously affected.


For more information, please see [Custom Capture and Rendering](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35158).

>?You can set `timestamp` in `frame` to `0`, so that the SDK will set the timestamp by itself. However, please "evenly" set the calling interval of `sendCustomAudioData`; otherwise, the audio will be unstable.

| bufferType | TRTCVideoBufferType | Specifies video data structure type. |
| callback | [ITRTCVideoRenderCallback](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35133#itrtcvideorendercallback) * | Custom rendering callback. |

__Return__

0: success; values smaller than 0: error.

>?After this method is set, the SDK will internally call back the captured data, skip the `HWND` rendering logic, and call `setLocalVideoRenderCallback(TRTCVideoPixelFormat_Unknown, TRTCVideoBufferType_Unknown, nullptr)` to stop the callback.


### setRemoteVideoRenderCallback

This API is used to set custom rendering for remote video.
```
int setRemoteVideoRenderCallback(const char * userId, TRTCVideoPixelFormat pixelFormat, TRTCVideoBufferType bufferType, ITRTCVideoRenderCallback * callback)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | const char * | User ID. |
| pixelFormat | TRTCVideoPixelFormat | Specifies the called back pixel format. |
| bufferType | TRTCVideoBufferType | Specifies video data structure type. |
| callback | [ITRTCVideoRenderCallback](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35133#itrtcvideorendercallback) * | Custom rendering callback. |

__Return__

0: success; values smaller than 0: error.

__Overview__

This method is similar to `setLocalVideoRenderDelegate`. The difference is that one is callback of rendering the local image, while the other is callback of rendering the remote image.

>?After this method is set, the SDK will internally call back the remote data after decoding it, skip the `HWND` rendering logic, and call `setRemoteVideoRenderCallback(userId, TRTCVideoPixelFormat_Unknown,  TRTCVideoBufferType_Unknown, nullptr)` to stop the callback.



### setAudioFrameCallback

This API is used to set audio data callback.
```
int setAudioFrameCallback(ITRTCAudioFrameCallback * callback)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| callback | [ITRTCAudioFrameCallback](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35133#itrtcaudioframecallback) * | Callback of audio frame data (in PCM format). If callback = nullptr, data callback will be stopped. |

__Return__

0: success; values smaller than 0: error.

__Overview__

After this method is set, the SDK will internally call back the data (in PCM format) from the audio module, including:
- onCapturedAudioFrame: audio data captured by current mic
- onPlayAudioFrame: audio data from each remote user before audio mixing
- onMixedPlayAudioFrame: audio data to be played back by speaker after audio data from each channel is mixed



## Custom Message Sending API Functions
### sendCustomCmdMsg

This API is used to send custom message to all users in the room.
```
bool sendCustomCmdMsg(uint32_t cmdId, const uint8_t * data, uint32_t dataSize, bool reliable, bool ordered)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| cmdId | uint32_t | Message ID. Value range: 1–10. |
| data | const uint8_t * | Message to be sent, which can contain up to 1 KB (1,000 bytes) of data. |
| dataSize | uint32_t | Size of the data to be sent. |
| reliable | bool | Whether reliable sending is enabled; if yes, the recipient needs to temporarily store the data of a certain period to wait for re-sending, which will cause certain delay. |
| ordered | bool | Whether orderly sending is enabled, i.e., whether the data should be received in the same order in which it is sent; if yes, the recipient needs to temporarily store and sort messages, which will cause certain delay. |

__Return__

true: message has been sent successful; false: failed to send message.

__Overview__

This API can be used to broadcast your custom data to other users in the room though the audio/video data channel. Due to reuse of this channel, please strictly control the frequency of sending custom messages and message size; otherwise, the quality control logic of the audio/video data will be affected, causing uncertain issues.

>?This API has the following restrictions:
>- Up to 30 messages can be sent per second to all users in the room.
>- A packet can contain up to 1 KB of data; if the threshold is exceeded, the packet is very likely to be discarded by the intermediate router or server.
>- A client can send up to 8 KB of data in total per second.
>- `reliable` and `ordered` must be set to the same value (`true` or `false`) and cannot be set to different values currently.
>- You are strongly recommended to use different `cmdIDs` for messages of different types. This can reduce message delay when orderly sending is required.


### sendSEIMsg

This API is used to embed custom data of a small size in video frames.
```
bool sendSEIMsg(const uint8_t * data, uint32_t dataSize, int32_t repeatCount)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| data | const uint8_t * | Data to be sent, which can contain up to 1 KB (1,000 bytes) of data. |
| dataSize | uint32_t | Size of the data to be sent. |
| repeatCount | int32_t | Data sending count. |

__Return__

true: the message is allowed and will be sent to subsequent video frames; false: the message is not allowed to be sent.

__Overview__

Different from how `sendCustomCmdMsg` works, `sendSEIMsg` directly inserts data into the video data header. Therefore, even if the video frames are relayed to LVB CDN, the data will always exist. However, as the data needs to be embedded in the video frames, it cannot be too large and is recommended to be of just several bytes.
The most common use is to embed the custom timestamp into video frames through `sendSEIMsg`. The biggest benefit of this scheme is that it can implement a perfect alignment between messages and video image.

>?This API has the following restrictions:
>- The data will not be instantly sent after this API is called; instead, it will be inserted into the next video frame after the API call.
>- Up to 30 messages can be sent per second to all users in the room (this limit is shared with `sendCustomCmdMsg`).
>- Each packet can be up to 1 KB (this limit is shared with `sendCustomCmdMsg`). If a large amount of data is sent, the video bitrate will increase, which may reduce the video quality or even cause lagging.
>- Each client can send up to 8 KB of data in total per second (this limit is shared with `sendCustomCmdMsg`).
>- If multiple times of sending is required (i.e., `repeatCount` > 1), the data will be inserted into subsequent `repeatCount` video frames in a row for sending, which will increase the video bitrate.
>- If `repeatCount` is greater than 1, the data will be sent for multiple times, and the same message may be received multiple times in the `onRecvSEIMsg` callback; therefore, deduplication is required.

This method plays back the specified audio data to test whether the speaker can function properly. If sound can be heard, the speaker is normal.


### stopSpeakerDeviceTest

This API is used to stop speaker test.
```
void stopSpeakerDeviceTest()
```



## MixTranscoding and CDN Relayed Push
### setMixTranscodingConfig

This API is used to start (update) On-Cloud MixTranscoding: this method uses the transcoding service of Tencent Cloud to combine multiple image channels into one channel.
```
void setMixTranscodingConfig(TRTCTranscodingConfig * config)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| config | [TRTCTranscodingConfig](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35134#trtctranscodingconfig) * | For more information, please see the description of [TRTCTranscodingConfig](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35134#trtctranscodingconfig) in `TRTCCloudDef.h`. If `NULL` is passed in, On-Cloud MixTranscoding will be canceled. |

__Overview__

This API will send a command to the Tencent Cloud transcoding server to combine multiple image channels in the room into one channel.
If you have enabled the "automatic relayed LVB" feature on the feature configuration page in the TRTC [Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/rav/), each image channel in the room will have a corresponding LVB [CDN address](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35242), and you can use On-Cloud MixTranscoding to mix multiple image channels from the LVB addresses to one channel and view the mixed image on LVB CDN.
You can use the transcoding parameters to set the position of each channel of image and quality of the final output image.
Reference document: [On-Cloud MixTranscoding](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35123/34618). Sample code: the demo provides the entry for trying out this feature. You can experience it in "On-Cloud Image Mix" and "Share Playback Address" in the "More Features" panel.


<pre>
**Image 1**=> decoding => =>
                        \
**Image 2**=> decoding =>  image mixing => encoding => **mixed image**
                        /
**Image 3**=> decoding => =>
</pre>


>?Notes on On-Cloud MixTranscoding:
>- On-cloud transcoding will cause a delay of 1–2 seconds in video playback with CDN.
>- If you call this function, the multiple channels of images will be mixed to the [CDN address](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35242) of your own channel.


### startPublishCDNStream

This API is used to relay stream to the specified push address.
```
void startPublishCDNStream(const TRTCPublishCDNParam & param)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| param | const [TRTCPublishCDNParam](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35134#trtcpublishcdnparam) & | For more information, please see the description of [TRTCPublishCDNParam](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35134#trtcpublishcdnparam) in `TRTCCloudDef.h`. |

__Overview__

This API will push a command to Tencent Cloud's relay server, and Tencent Cloud will push the current channel of audio/video to your specified RTMP push address.
If you have enabled the "automatic relayed LVB" feature on the feature configuration page in the TRTC [Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/rav/), each channel of image in the room will have a default CDN address. Therefore, this feature is not commonly used and required only if you need to configure multiple CDN providers.
As relaying an individual channel of image to LVB CDN is generally meaningless, this feature is usually used with On-Cloud MixTranscoding, i.e., `setMixTranscodingConfig` is used to mix multiple image channels to one channel and then relay it.

>?Notes on relayed push:
>- By default, audio/video streams can be relayed only to the Tencent Cloud RTMP [push address](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/32480). To relay streams to other cloud services, please submit a ticket to contact us.
>- If you call this function, only your own channel of image will be relayed to the specified RTMP push address. Therefore, this API usually needs to be used together with `setMixTranscodingConfig`.
>- In TRTC, each channel of image in the room will have a default CDN address (which needs to be enabled). Therefore, this feature is not commonly used and required only if you need to configure multiple CDN providers.


### stopPublishCDNStream

This API is used to stop relayed push.
```
void stopPublishCDNStream()
```



## Log API Functions
