__Attribute list__

| Attribute | Type | Description | Recommended Value |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| sdkAppId | UInt32 | Application ID, which is required. Tencent Cloud generates bills based on `sdkAppId`. | The ID can be obtained on the account information page in the TRTC Console after the corresponding application is created. |
| userId | NSString * | User ID, which is required. It is the `userId` of the local user and acts as the login username. | If the ID of a user in your account system is "abc", `userId` can be set to "`abc`". |
| userSig | NSString * | User signature, which is required. It is the authentication signature corresponding to the current `userId` and acts as the login password. | For more information on the calculation method, please see [How to Calculate `UserSig`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35166). |
| roomId | UInt32 | Room number, which is required. Users in the same room can see and make video calls to one another. | The parameter value can be customized but must be unique. If the user ID (`userId`) is numeric, the room creator's user ID can be directly used as the `roomId`. |
| role | [TRTCRoleType](#trtcroletype) | Role, which applies only to the LVB scenario (`TRTCAppSceneLIVE`) and does not take effect in the video call scenario. | Default value: anchor (`TRTCRoleAnchor`). |
| privateMapKey | NSString * | Room signature, which is optional. If you want only users with the specified `userIds` to enter a room, you need to use `privateMapKey` to restrict the permission. | You are recommended to use this parameter only if you have high security requirements.

## TRTCVideoQosPreference

__Feature__

Image quality preference.

__Overview__

This specifies whether to "ensure smoothness" or "ensure definition" when the TRTC SDK is used on a weak network:

- Smooth: smoothness is ensured on a weak network, i.e., ensuring the smoothness and sending of the audio, while the video image will have a lot of blurs but can be smooth with no lagging.
- Clear: definition is ensured on a weak network, i.e., the image will be as clear as possible but tend to lag.


| Enumerated Value | Description |
|-----|-----|
| TRTCVideoQosPreferenceSmooth | Ensures smoothness on a weak network. |
| TRTCVideoQosPreferenceClear | Ensures definition on a weak network. |


## TRTCAudioSampleRate

__Feature__

Audio sample rate.

__Overview__

The audio sample rate is used to measure the audio fidelity. A higher sample rate indicates higher fidelity. If there is music in the application scenario, `TRTCAudioSampleRate48000` will be recommended.

| Enumerated Value | Description |
|-----|-----|
| TRTCAudioSampleRate16000 | 16 kHz sample rate. |
| TRTCAudioSampleRate32000 | 32 kHz sample rate. |

## TRTCAudioRoute

__Feature__

Audio playback mode (audio routing).

__Overview__
The hands-free mode of video call features in WeChat and Mobile QQ is implemented based on audio routing. Generally, a mobile phone has two speakers, one is the receiver at the top with low volume, and the other is the stereo speaker at the bottom with high volume. The purpose of setting audio routing is to determine which speaker will be used.
- Speakerphone: speaker at the bottom of a phone, which has high volume and is suitable for playing back music.
- Earpiece: receiver at the top of a phone, which has low volume and is suitable for calls.

## TRTCSystemVolumeType

__Feature__

System volume type.

__Overview__

Smartphones usually have two system volume types, i.e., call volume and media volume.
- Call volume: volume type dedicated to the VoIP scenario. It will forcibly enable acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) and has low sound quality, and its volume level cannot be set to 0.
- Media volume: volume type dedicated to music and movie playback through players. It will not enable AEC and can be set to 0 with the volume buttons on the phone. In media volume mode, AEC can be implemented by using the SDK's built-in acoustic algorithm if needed.

Currently, the SDK provides two control modes of system volume types, including:
- TRTCSystemVolumeTypeAuto: "call volume with mic and media volume without mic", i.e., the call volume mode will be used in a call, while the media volume mode will be used when a user only watches the video without speaking.
- TRTCSystemVolumeTypeMedia: the media volume will be used all the time. If a user is on a call, the SDK will use the built-in algorithm for AEC. 

>Considering the increment in the installation package size, only the SDKs in the TRTC Enterprise and Professional editions contain the acoustic algorithm library. **If `TRTCSystemVolumeTypeMedia` is selected in the TRTC Lite edition, echo issues will occur, so please do so with caution.**


| Enumerated Value | Description |
|-----|-----|
| TRTCSystemVolumeTypeAuto | Default type, in which the SDK automatically selects the appropriate volume type. |
| TRTCSystemVolumeTypeMedia | Only the media volume is used, and the SDK does not use the call volume. |


## TRTCLogLevel
