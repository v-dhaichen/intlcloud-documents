- Anchor: anchor, who can upstream video and audio. Up to 20 anchors are allowed to upstream videos at the same time in one room.
- Audience: viewer, who can only watch the video but cannot upstream video or audio. There is no upper limit for the number of viewers in one room.

| Constant | Description |
|-----|-----|
| TRTCRoleAnchor | Anchor. |
| TRTCRoleAudience | Viewer. |

## 2.3. Bandwidth Limit Mode

The TRTC SDK needs to adjust the internal codecs and network module based on the network conditions in real-time to respond to network changes. To support fast algorithm upgrade, the SDK provides two network bandwidth limit modes:
- ModeServer: on-cloud control, which is the default and recommended mode.
- ModeClient: client-based control, which is for internal debugging of SDK and shall not be used by users.

Smartphones usually have two system volume types, i.e., call volume and media volume.
- Call volume: volume type dedicated to the VoIP scenario. It will forcibly enable acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) and has low sound quality, and its volume level cannot be set to 0.
- Media volume: volume type dedicated to music and movie playback through players. It will not enable AEC and can be set to 0 with the volume buttons on the phone. In media volume mode, AEC can be implemented by using the SDK's built-in acoustic algorithm if needed.

Currently, the SDK provides two control modes of system volume types, including:
- TRTCSystemVolumeTypeAuto: "call volume with mic and media volume without mic", i.e., the call volume mode will be used in a call, while the media volume mode will be used when a user only watches the video without speaking.

## TRTCAudioRecordingParams

__Feature__

Audio recording parameters.

__Overview__

Please set the parameters correctly to ensure that the audio recording file can be successfully generated.




__Attribute list__

| Attribute | Type | Description | Remarks |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| filePath | String |File path, which is the path to the audio recording file and is required. The path needs to be specified by the user and must exist in the application and be writable. | The file name and its extension need to be specified in the path, and the extension determines the format of the audio recording file. Currently supported formats are PCM, WAV, and AAC. For example, if the specified path is `path/to/audio.aac`, a file in AAC format will be generated. Please specify a valid path that is readable/writable; otherwise, the audio recording file cannot be generated. |


## TRTCAudioEffectParam

__Feature__

Audio effect.


__Attribute list__

| Attribute | Type | Description | Remarks |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| effectId | int | Audio effect ID. Each audio effect needs to be assigned with a unique ID, through which the audio effect can be manipulated, such as starting/stopping and adjusting volume level. | - |
| path | String | Absolute path to the audio effect file. | - |
| loopCount | int | Number of loop playback times of audio effect. | Value range: 0 or any positive integer. Default value: 0. 0 indicates that the audio effect will be played back once; 1 indicates that the audio effect will be played back twice; and so on. |
| publish | boolean | Whether to send audio effect to remote users. | YES: when the audio effect is played back locally, it will be upstreamed to the cloud and can be heard by remote users; NO: the audio effect will not be upstreamed to the cloud and can only be heard locally. Default value: NO. |
| volume | int | Volume level of audio effect. | Value range: 0–100. Default value: 100. |


## TRTCStatistics

__Feature__

Statistics.




__Attribute list__

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| appCpu | int | CPU utilization of the current application in percent (%). |
| systemCpu | int | CPU utilization of the current system in percent (%). |
| rtt | int | Delay in milliseconds, which is the round-trip time between the SDK and server. The smaller the value, the better. Generally `rtt` lower than 50 ms is satisfactory, while `rtt` higher than 100 ms will result in long call latency. As data upstreaming and downstreaming share the same network connection, `rtt` is the same for the local user and remote user. |
| upLoss | int | Client-to-server upstream packet loss rate in percent (%). The smaller the value, the better. For example, if the packet loss rate is 0, it means the network conditions are good. If the value is 30%, it indicates that 30% of data packets sent to the server by the SDK were lost during upstreaming. |
| downLoss | int | Server-to-client downstream packet loss rate in percent (%). The smaller the value, the better. For example, if the packet loss rate is 0, it means the network conditions are good. If the value is 30%, it indicates that 30% of data packets sent to the server by the SDK were lost during downstreaming. |
| sendBytes | long | Total number of bytes sent. Note that this is the number of bytes but not bits. |
| receiveBytes | long | Total number of bytes received. Note that this is the number of bytes but not bits. |
| localArray | ArrayList[TRTCLocalStatistics](#trtcremotestatistics) | Local audio/video statistics, which are an array since they may contain statistics of multiple channels, such as big image, small image, and secondary channel image. |
| remoteArray | ArrayList[TRTCRemoteStatistics](#trtcremotestatistics) | Remote audio/video statistics, which are an array since they may contain statistics of multiple channels, such as big image, small image, and secondary channel image. |


## TRTCRemoteStatistics

__Feature__

Audio/video statistics of a remote user.




__Attribute list__

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | String | User ID, which specifies the user whose video stream is to be queried. |
| finalLoss | int | Total packet loss rate of this line in percent (%). A smaller value is preferred; for example, if the packet loss rate is 0, it means the network conditions are good. The packet loss rate is the total packet loss rate in one turn of upstreaming and downstreaming between the `userId` and server. If `downLoss` is 0% but `finalLoss` is not 0, it indicates that there was an irrecoverable packet loss in upstreaming from the `userId`. |
| width | int | Video width. |
| height | int | Video height. |
| frameRate | int | Receipt frame rate in fps. |
| videoBitrate | int | Video bitrate in Kbps. |
| audioSampleRate | int | Audio sample rate in Hz. |
| audioBitrate | int | Audio bitrate in Kbps. |
| streamType | int | Stream type (big image &#124; small image &#124; secondary channel image). |
