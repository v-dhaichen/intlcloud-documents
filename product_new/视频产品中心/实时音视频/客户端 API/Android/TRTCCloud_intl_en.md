TRTCCloud @ TXLiteAVSDK.

Main API class for the TRTC video call feature.


## Basic Methods
### sharedInstance

This API is used to create [TRTCCloud](#trtccloud) singleton.
```
TRTCCloud sharedInstance(Context context)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| context | Context | Android context, which will be converted to `ApplicationContext` for the system APIs to call. |

__Return__

[TRTCCloud](#trtccloud) instance.

>`destroySharedInstance` can be called to terminate a singleton object.


### destroySharedInstance

This API is used to terminate [TRTCCloud](#trtccloud) singleton.
```
void destroySharedInstance()
```


### setListener

This API is used to set the `TRTCCloudListener` callback API, through which users can get various status notifications from `[TRTCCloud](#trtccloud)`.
```
abstract void setListener(TRTCCloudListener listener)
```

__Overview__

You can use [TRTCCloudListener](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35127#trtccloudlistener) to get various status notifications from the SDK. For more information, please see the definitions in [TRTCCloudListener](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35127#trtccloudlistener).


### setListenerHandler

This API is used to set the queue that drives the [TRTCCloudListener](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35127#trtccloudlistener) callback.
```
abstract void setListenerHandler(Handler listenerHandler)
```

__Overview__

The SDK uses the main thread as the driver of `TRTCCloudListener` by default, which means, if you do not specify `listenerHandler`, the [TRTCCloudListener](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35127#trtccloudlistener) callback of the SDK will be called by the main thread. Your operation on UI in the callback function of [TRTCCloudListener](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35127#trtccloudlistener) is thread-safe now.



## Room API Functions
### enterRoom

This API is used to enter room.
```
abstract void enterRoom(TRTCCloudDef.TRTCParams param, int scene)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| param | [TRTCCloudDef.TRTCParams](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35129#trtcparams) | Room entry parameters. For more information, please see `TRTCParams`. |
| scene | int | Application scenario. Currently, only video call (`VideoCall`) and LVB (`Live) scenarios are supported. |

__Overview__

After this API is called, the `onEnterRoom(result)` callback from [TRTCCloudListener](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35127#trtccloudlistener) will be received: if room entry succeeded, `result` will be a positive number (`result` > 0), indicating the time in milliseconds (ms) used for entering the room; otherwise, `result` will be a negative number (`result` < 0), indicating the error code for room entry failure. For more information, please see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35130).

>No matter whether room entry is successful, `enterRoom` must be used together with `exitRoom`. If `enterRoom` is called again before `exitRoom` is called, an unexpected error will occur.



### exitRoom

This API is used to exit room.
```
abstract void exitRoom()
```

__Overview__

When the [exitRoom()](#exitroom) API is called, the logic related to room exit will be executed, such as releasing resources of audio/video devices and codecs. After resources are released, the SDK will use the `onExitRoom()` callback in [TRTCCloudListener](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35127#trtccloudlistener) to notify you.
If you need to call [enterRoom()](#enterroom) again or switch to another audio/video SDK, please wait until you receive the `onExitRoom()` callback; otherwise, exceptions such as occupied camera or mic may occur; for example, the common issue with switching between media volume and call volume on Android is caused by this problem.


### switchRole

This API is used to switch roles and applies only to the LVB scenario (`TRTCAppSceneLIVE`).
```
abstract void switchRole(int role)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| role | int | Target role, which is anchor by default. |

__Overview__

In the LVB scenario, a user may need to switch between "viewer" and "anchor" roles. You can use the `role` field in `TRTCParams` before room entry to determine the role or use the `switchRole` API to switch roles after room entry.


### ConnectOtherRoom

This API is used to request cross-room call (anchor competition).
```
abstract void ConnectOtherRoom(String param)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| param | String | Co-anchoring parameters in the format of JSON string. `roomId` indicates the target room number, and `userId` indicates the target user ID. |

__Overview__

In TRTC, two anchors in different rooms can use the "cross-room call" feature to co-anchor across the rooms. They can engage in "co-anchoring competition" without the need to exit their own rooms.
For example, when anchor A in room "001" uses `connectOtherRoom()` to successfully call anchor B in room "002", all users in room "001" will receive the `onUserEnter(B)` and `onUserVideoAvailable(B,true)` callbacks of anchor B, and all users in room "002" will receive the `onUserEnter(A)` and `onUserVideoAvailable(A,true)` callbacks of anchor A.
In short, cross-room call is to share between two anchors in different rooms, so that users in either room can see both of them.


<pre>
               Room 001                    Room 002
            --------------              -------------
 Before cross-room call: | Anchor A      |             | Anchor B     |
            | Viewers U, V, and W  |             | Viewers X, Y, and Z |
            --------------              -------------</pre>



<pre>              Room 001                     Room 002
            --------------              -------------
 After cross-room call: | Anchors A and B    |             | Anchors B and A   |
            | Viewers U, V, and W  |             | Viewers X, Y, and Z |
            --------------              -------------
</pre>

For the sake of compatibility of subsequent extended fields for cross-room call, parameters in JSON format are used currently and must contain at least two fields:
- `roomId`: If anchor A in room "001" wants to co-anchor with anchor B in room "002", the `roomId` must be set to `002` when anchor A calls [ConnectOtherRoom()](#connectotherroom).
- `userId`: If anchor A in room "001" wants to co-anchor with anchor B in room "002", the `userId` must be set to the `userId` of anchor B when anchor A calls [ConnectOtherRoom()](#connectotherroom).


The result of requesting cross-room call will be returned through the `onConnectOtherRoom()` callback in [TRTCCloudListener](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35127#trtccloudlistener).


<pre>
  JSONObject jsonObj = new JSONObject();
  jsonObj.put("roomId"， 002);
  jsonObj.put("userId"， "userB");
  trtc.ConnectOtherRoom(jsonObj.toString());
</pre>


### DisconnectOtherRoom

This API is used to exit cross-room call.
```
abstract void DisconnectOtherRoom()
```

__Overview__

The result of exiting cross-room call will be returned through the `onDisconnectOtherRoom` callback in `TRTCCloudListener.java`.


### setDefaultStreamRecvMode

This API is used to set audio/video data reception mode, which must be set before room entry for it to take effect.
```
abstract void setDefaultStreamRecvMode(boolean autoRecvAudio, boolean autoRecvVideo)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| autoRecvAudio | boolean | true: audio data will be automatically received; false: `muteRemoteAudio` needs to be called to send or cancel a request. Default value: true. |
| autoRecvVideo | boolean | true: video data will be automatically received; false: `startRemoteView/stopRemoteView` needs to be called to send or cancel a request. Default value: true. |

__Overview__

To deliver an excellent instant broadcasting experience, the SDK automatically receives audio/video upon successful room entry by default, that is, you will immediately receive audio/video data from all remote users. If you do not call `startRemoteView`, video data will be automatically canceled due to timeout. If you use this API mainly in scenarios where automatic video data reception is not required, such as audio chat, you can select the reception mode based on your actual needs.

>This API takes effect only if it is set before room entry.




## Video API Functions
### startLocalPreview

This API is used to enable preview image of local video.
```
abstract void startLocalPreview(boolean frontCamera, TXCloudVideoView view)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| frontCamera | boolean | true: front camera; false: rear camera. |
| view | TXCloudVideoView | Control that carries the video image. |

__Overview__

When the first video frame starts to be rendered, you will receive the `onFirstVideoFrame(null)` callback in [TRTCCloudListener](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35127#trtccloudlistener).


### stopLocalPreview

```
abstract void stopLocalPreview()
```


### muteLocalVideo

This API is used to specify whether to block local video image.
```
abstract void muteLocalVideo(boolean mute)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|

| view | TXCloudVideoView | Control that carries the video image. |

__Overview__

If you receive the `onUserVideoAvailable(userId, true)` notification from the SDK, you can know that the remote user has enabled the video image. Later, when you use the `startRemoteView(userId)` API to load the remote image of this user, you can use a loading animation to optimize the experience for awaiting video loading. When the first video frame of this user starts to be displayed, you will receive the `onFirstVideoFrame(userId)` event callback.


### stopRemoteView

This API is used to stop displaying remote video image.
```
abstract void stopRemoteView(String userId)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | String | ID of remote user. |

__Overview__

After this API is called, the SDK will stop receiving the remote video stream of the specified user and clear relevant video displaying resources.


### stopAllRemoteView

This API is used to stop displaying all remote video images.

| smallVideoEncParam | [TRTCCloudDef.TRTCVideoEncParam](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35129#trtcvideoencparam) | Video parameters of small image stream. |

__Return__

0: success; -1: the big image is already of the lowest image quality.

__Overview__

If the current user is a major role (such as anchor, teacher, or host) in the room and uses PC or Mac, this mode can be enabled. In this mode, the current user will output two channels of video streams, i.e., **HD** and **LD**, at the same time (only one channel of audio stream will be output though). This mode will consume more network bandwidth and CPU computing resources.
As for remote viewers in the same room:
- If the downstream network is good, they can select the **HD** image.
- If the downstream network is poor, they can select the **LD** image.

>Dual-channel encoding will consume more CPU resources and network bandwidth; therefore, this feature can be enabled on macOS, Windows, or high-spec tablets, but should not be enabled on phones.



### setRemoteVideoStreamType

This API is used to select whether to view the big or small image of the specified `uid`.
```
abstract int setRemoteVideoStreamType(String userId, int streamType)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | String | User ID. |
| streamType | int | Video stream type, i.e., big image or small image. Default value: big image. |

__Overview__

To implement this feature, the dual-channel encoding mode must be enabled by the `uid` through `enableEncSmallVideoStream`; otherwise, this operation will not take effect.


### setPriorRemoteVideoStreamType

This API is used to set the video quality preferred by viewers.
```
abstract int setPriorRemoteVideoStreamType(int streamType)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| streamType | int | Selects whether to watch big image or small image. Default value: big image. |

__Overview__

It is recommended to select the LD small image for low-spec devices first. If the dual-channel encoding mode is not enabled, this operation will not take effect.



## Audio API Functions
### startLocalAudio

This API is used to enable local audio capture and upstreaming.
```
abstract void startLocalAudio()
```

__Overview__

This function will start mic capture and transmit audio data to other users in the room.
The SDK does not enable local audio capture and upstreaming by default, and you need to call this function to enable it; otherwise, other users in the room cannot hear you.

>This function will check the mic permission. If the current application does not have permission to use the mic, the SDK will ask the user to grant the permission.



### stopLocalAudio

This API is used to disable local audio capture and upstreaming.
```
abstract void stopLocalAudio()
```

__Overview__

When local audio capture and upstreaming is disabled, other members in the room will receive the `onUserAudioAvailable(false)` callback notification.


### muteLocalAudio

This API is used to mute local audio.
```
abstract void muteLocalAudio(boolean mute)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| mute | boolean | true: blocks; false: enables. Default value: false. |

__Overview__

After local audio is muted, other members in the room will receive the `onUserAudioAvailable(false)` callback notification.
Different from `stopLocalAudio`, `muteLocalAudio` will not stop sending audio/video data; instead, it continues to send mute packets of an extremely low bitrate. Since some video file formats such as MP4 have a high requirement for audio continuity, an MP4 recording file cannot be played back smoothly if `stopLocalAudio` is used. Therefore, `muteLocalAudio` is recommended in scenarios where the requirement for recording quality is high, so as to record MP4 files with better compatibility.

### setAudioRoute

This API is used to set audio routing.
```
abstract void setAudioRoute(int route)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| route | int | Audio routing, i.e., whether the audio is output by speaker or receiver. For more information, please see [TRTCCloudDef.TRTC_AUDIO_ROUTE_SPEAKER](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35129#TRTC_AUDIO_ROUTE). Default value: TRTC_AUDIO_ROUTE_SPEAKER. |

__Overview__

The hands-free mode of video call features in WeChat and Mobile QQ is implemented based on audio routing. Generally, a mobile phone has two speakers, one is the receiver at the top with low volume, and the other is the stereo speaker at the bottom with high volume. The purpose of setting audio routing is to determine which speaker will be used.


### muteRemoteAudio

```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| intervalMs | int | Determines the interval in ms for triggering the `onUserVoiceVolume` callback. The minimum interval is 100 ms. If the value is smaller than 0, the callback will be disabled. It is recommended to set this parameter to 300 ms. For detailed callback rules, please see the description of `onUserVoiceVolume`. |

__Overview__

After this feature is enabled, the evaluation result of the volume level will be obtained in `onUserVoiceVolume`. To enable this feature, call this API before calling [startLocalAudio()](#startlocalaudio).

>The volume bar in the demo is implemented based on this API.

### startAudioRecording

This API is used to start audio recording.

## Secondary Stream API Functions
### startRemoteSubStreamView

This API is used to start displaying screen sharing image of a remote user.
```
abstract void startRemoteSubStreamView(String userId, TXCloudVideoView view)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | String | ID of remote user. |
| view | TXCloudVideoView | Rendering control. |

__Overview__

Different from [startRemoteView()](#startremoteview) that is used to display the primary image, this API can only be used to display the image of the secondary channel (e.g., screen sharing and remote video playback).

>This API must be called after `onUserSubStreamAvailable` is called back.



### stopRemoteSubStreamView

This API is used to stop displaying screen sharing image of a remote user.
```
abstract void stopRemoteSubStreamView(String userId)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|

## Custom Capture and Rendering API Functions
### enableCustomVideoCapture

This API is used to enable custom video capture mode.
```
abstract void enableCustomVideoCapture(boolean enable)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| enable | boolean | Whether to enable. true: yes; false: no. Default value: false. |

__Overview__

After the custom mode is enabled, the SDK will not run the original video capture process and retain only the encoding and sending capabilities. You need to use [sendCustomVideoData()](#sendcustomvideodata) to continuously insert the captured video image into the SDK.


### sendCustomVideoData

This API is used to deliver the captured video data to the SDK.
```
abstract void sendCustomVideoData(TRTCCloudDef.TRTCVideoFrame frame)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| frame | [TRTCCloudDef.TRTCVideoFrame](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35129#trtcvideoframe) | Video data. If the `buffer` scheme is used, please set the `data` field; if the `texture` scheme is used, please set the `TRTCTexture` object. |

__Overview__

Android supports two schemes:
- `buffer` scheme: its connection is easy but its performance is poor, so it is not suitable for scenarios with high resolution.
- `texture` scheme: its connection requires certain knowledge in OpenGL but its performance is well. For resolution higher than 640 * 360, please use this scheme.


For more information, please see [Custom Capture and Rendering](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35158).

>
>- The SDK has an internal frame rate control logic, and the target frame rate set in `setVideoEncoderParam` shall prevail. If the frame rate is too high, automatic frame discarding may occur; if too low, automatic frame interpolation will be implemented.
>- It is recommended to set `timestamp` in `frame` to 0, so that the SDK will set the timestamp by itself. However, please "evenly" set the calling interval of `sendCustomVideoData`; otherwise, the video frame rate will be unstable.


### setLocalVideoRenderListener

This API is used to set callback of custom rendering for local video.
```
abstract int setLocalVideoRenderListener(int pixelFormat, int bufferType, TRTCCloudListener.TRTCVideoRenderListener listener)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| pixelFormat | int | Specifies the pixel format of video frame, such as TRTC_VIDEO_PIXEL_FORMAT_I420 or TRTC_VIDEO_PIXEL_FORMAT_Texture_2D. |
| bufferType | int | Specifies the data structure of video frame. `TRTC_VIDEO_BUFFER_TYPE_BYTE_BUFFER` or `TRTC_VIDEO_BUFFER_TYPE_BYTE_ARRAY` corresponds to `pixelFormat` of `TRTC_VIDEO_PIXEL_FORMAT_I420`; `TRTC_VIDEO_BUFFER_TYPE_TEXTURE` corresponds to `pixelFormat` of `TRTC_VIDEO_PIXEL_FORMAT_Texture_2D`. |
| listener | [TRTCCloudListener.TRTCVideoRenderListener](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35127#trtcvideorenderlistener) | Callback of custom video rendering. The callback is returned once for each video frame. |

__Return__

0: success; values smaller than 0: error.

__Overview__

After this method is set, the SDK will skip its own rendering process and call back the captured data. Therefore, you need to complete image rendering on your own.
- `pixelFormat` specifies the format of the called back data. Currently, Texture2D and I420 are supported.
- `bufferType` specifies the buffer type. `BYTE_BUFFER` is suitable for the JNI layer, while `BYTE_ARRAY` can be used in direct operations at the Java layer.


For more information, please see [Custom Capture and Rendering](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35158).


### setRemoteVideoRenderListener

This API is used to set callback of custom rendering for remote video.
```
abstract int setRemoteVideoRenderListener(String userId, int pixelFormat, int bufferType, TRTCCloudListener.TRTCVideoRenderListener listener)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | String | ID of remote user. |
| pixelFormat | int | Specifies the pixel format of video frame. Currently, only `TRTC_VIDEO_PIXEL_FORMAT_I420` is supported. |
| bufferType | int | Specifies the data structure of video frame, such as `TRTC_VIDEO_BUFFER_TYPE_BYTE_BUFFER` or `TRTC_VIDEO_BUFFER_TYPE_BYTE_ARRAY`. |
| listener | [TRTCCloudListener.TRTCVideoRenderListener](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35127#trtcvideorenderlistener) | Callback of custom video rendering. The callback is returned once for each video frame. |

__Return__

0: success; values smaller than 0: error.

__Overview__

This method is similar to `setLocalVideoRenderListener`. The difference is that one is callback of rendering the local image, while the other is callback of rendering the remote image.
For more information, please see [Custom Capture and Rendering](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35158).

>In practice, `startRemoteView(userid, null)` needs to be called first to initiate pull of the remote video stream, and `view` needs to be set to `null`; otherwise, the SDK will not start the custom rendering process, and the callback function of `listener` will not be triggered.



### enableCustomAudioCapture

This API is used to enable custom audio capture mode.
```
abstract void enableCustomAudioCapture(boolean enable)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| enable | boolean | Whether to enable. true: yes; false: no. Default value: false. |

__Overview__

After the custom mode is enabled, the SDK will not run the original audio capture process and retain only the encoding and sending capabilities. You need to use [sendCustomAudioData()](#sendcustomaudiodata) to continuously insert the captured audio data into the SDK.


### sendCustomAudioData

This API is used to deliver the captured audio data to the SDK.
```
abstract void sendCustomAudioData(TRTCCloudDef.TRTCAudioFrame frame)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| frame | [TRTCCloudDef.TRTCAudioFrame](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35129#trtcaudioframe) | Audio frame. Currently, only mono channel and 48 kHz sample rate are supported. |

__Overview__

It is recommended to enter the following information for `TRTCAudioFrame`:
- data: audio frame buffer. Audio frame data must be in PCM format, and it is recommended to set sampling time to 20 ms for each frame. **For example, if the sample rate is 48000, then the frame length for mono channel will be `48000 * 0.02s * 1 * 16 bit = 15360 bit = 1920 bytes`.**
- sampleRate: sample rate. Currently, only 48000 is supported.
- channel: number of channels (if stereo is used, data is interwoven). Valid values: 1: mono channel; 2: dual channel.
- timestamp: if the intervals for `timestamp` are uneven, the audio/video sync and quality of MP4 recording will be seriously affected.


For more information, please see [Custom Capture and Rendering](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35158).

>You can set `timestamp` in `frame` to `0`, so that the SDK will set the timestamp by itself. However, please "evenly" set the calling interval of `sendCustomAudioData`; otherwise, the audio will be unstable.



### setAudioFrameListener

This API is used to set audio data callback.
```
abstract void setAudioFrameListener(TRTCCloudListener.TRTCAudioFrameListener listener)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| listener | [TRTCCloudListener.TRTCAudioFrameListener](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35127#trtcaudioframelistener) | Audio data callback. If `listener = null`, data callback will be stopped. |

__Overview__

After this method is set, the SDK will internally call back the audio data (in PCM format), including:
- onCapturedAudioFrame: audio data captured by current mic
- onPlayAudioFrame: audio data from each remote user before audio mixing
- onMixedPlayAudioFrame: audio data to be played back by speaker after audio data from each channel is mixed



## Custom Message Sending API Functions
### sendCustomCmdMsg

This API is used to send custom message to all users in the room.
```
abstract boolean sendCustomCmdMsg(int cmdID, byte[] data, boolean reliable, boolean ordered)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| cmdID | int | Message ID. Value range: 1–10. |
| data | byte[] | Message to be sent, which can contain up to 1 KB (1,000 bytes) of data. |
| reliable | boolean | Whether reliable sending is enabled; if yes, the recipient needs to temporarily store the data of a certain period to wait for re-sending, which will cause certain delay. |
| ordered | boolean | Whether orderly sending is enabled, i.e., whether the data should be received in the same order in which it is sent; if yes, the recipient needs to temporarily store and sort messages, which will cause certain delay. |

__Return__

true: message has been sent successful; false: failed to send message.

__Overview__

This API can be used to broadcast your custom data to other users in the room though the audio/video data channel. Due to reuse of this channel, please strictly control the frequency of sending custom messages and message size; otherwise, the quality control logic of the audio/video data will be affected, causing uncertain issues.

>This API has the following restrictions:
>- Up to 30 messages can be sent per second to all users in the room.
>- A packet can contain up to 1 KB of data; if the threshold is exceeded, the packet is very likely to be discarded by the intermediate router or server.
>- A client can send up to 8 KB of data in total per second.
>- `reliable` and `ordered` must be set to the same value (`true` or `false`) and cannot be set to different values currently.
>- You are strongly recommended to use different `cmdIDs` for messages of different types. This can reduce message delay when orderly sending is required.


### sendSEIMsg

This API is used to embed custom data of a small size in video frames.
```
abstract boolean sendSEIMsg(byte[] data, int repeatCount)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| data | byte[] | Data to be sent, which can be up to 1 KB (1,000 bytes). |
| repeatCount | int | Data sending count. |

__Return__

true: the message is allowed and will be sent to subsequent video frames; false: the message is not allowed to be sent.

__Overview__

Different from how `sendCustomCmdMsg` works, `sendSEIMsg` directly inserts data into the video data header. Therefore, even if the video frames are relayed to LVB CDN, the data will always exist. As the data needs to be embedded in the video frames, it is recommended to keep the data size under several bytes.
The most common use is to embed the custom timestamp into video frames through `sendSEIMsg`. The biggest benefit of this scheme is that it can implement a perfect alignment between messages and video image.

>This API has the following restrictions:
>- The data will not be instantly sent after this API is called; instead, it will be inserted into the next video frame after the API call.
>- Up to 30 messages can be sent per second to all users in the room (this limit is shared with `sendCustomCmdMsg`).
>- Each packet can be up to 1 KB (this limit is shared with `sendCustomCmdMsg`). If a large amount of data is sent, the video bitrate will increase, which may reduce the video quality or even cause lagging.
>- Each client can send up to 8 KB of data in total per second (this limit is shared with `sendCustomCmdMsg`).
>- If multiple times of sending is required (i.e., `repeatCount` > 1), the data will be inserted into subsequent `repeatCount` video frames in a row for sending, which will increase the video bitrate.
>- If `repeatCount` is greater than 1, the data will be sent for multiple times, and the same message may be received multiple times in the `onRecvSEIMsg` callback; therefore, deduplication is required.

| sdkAppId | int | Application ID. |
| userId | String | User ID. |
| userSig | String | User signature. |

__Overview__

The speed test result will be used to optimize the SDK's subsequent selection policy. It is recommended to perform the speed test before users place the first call, which will help select the optimal server. If the test result is not satisfactory, you can use a noticeable UI prompt to remind the user to select a better network. The test result will be called back through [TRTCCloudListener.onSpeedTest](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35127#onspeedtest).

>The speed test will consume a certain amount of traffic and generate a small amount of extra traffic fees as a result.

```
abstract void startPublishCDNStream(TRTCCloudDef.TRTCPublishCDNParam param)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| param | [TRTCCloudDef.TRTCPublishCDNParam](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35129#trtcpublishcdnparam) | For more information, please see the description of `TRTCPublishCDNParam` in `TRTCCloudDef.java`. |

__Overview__

This API will push a command to Tencent Cloud's relay server, and Tencent Cloud will push the current channel of audio/video to your specified RTMP push address.
If you have enabled the "automatic relayed LVB" feature on the feature configuration page in the TRTC [Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/rav/), each channel of image in the room will have a default CDN address. Therefore, this feature is not commonly used and required only if you need to configure multiple CDN providers.
As relaying an individual channel of image to LVB CDN is generally meaningless, this feature is usually used with On-Cloud MixTranscoding, i.e., `setMixTranscodingConfig` is used to mix multiple image channels to one channel and then relay it.

>Notes on relayed push:
>- By default, audio/video streams can be relayed only to the Tencent Cloud RTMP [push address](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/32480). To relay streams to other cloud services, please submit a ticket to contact us.
>- If you call this function, only your own channel of image will be relayed to the specified RTMP push address. Therefore, this API usually needs to be used together with `setMixTranscodingConfig`.
>- In TRTC, each channel of image in the room will have a default CDN address (which needs to be enabled). Therefore, this feature is not commonly used and required only if you need to configure multiple CDN providers.
