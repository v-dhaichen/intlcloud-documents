TRTCCloudListener @ TXLiteAVSDK.

Event callback API for TRTC video call feature.


## Error Events and Warning Events
### onError

Callback for error: SDK encountered an irrecoverable error and must be listened on. Corresponding UI reminders should be displayed based on the actual conditions.
```
void onError(int errCode, String errMsg, Bundle extraInfo)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| errCode | int | Error code. |
| errMsg | String | Error message. |
| extraInfo | Bundle | Extended field. Certain error codes may carry extra information for troubleshooting. |


### onWarning

Callback for warning: this callback is used to alert to some non-serious problems such as lag or recoverable decoding failure.
```
void onWarning(int warningCode, String warningMsg, Bundle extraInfo)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| warningCode | int | Error code. |
| warningMsg | String | Warning message. |
| extraInfo | Bundle | Extended field. Certain warning codes may carry extra information for troubleshooting. |



## Room Event Callbacks
### onEnterRoom

Callback of room entry.
```
void onEnterRoom(long result)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| result | long | If `result` is greater than 0, it will be the time used for room entry in ms; if `result` is smaller than 0, it will be room entry error code. |

__Overview__

After the `enterRoom()` API in [TRTCCloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35126#trtccloud) is called to enter a room, the `onEnterRoom(result)` callback will be received from the SDK.
- If room entry succeeded, `result` will be a positive number (`result` > 0), indicating the time in milliseconds (ms) used for entering the room.
- If room entry failed, `result` will be a negative number (`result` < 0), indicating the error code for room entry failure. For more information, please see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35130).


>In TRTC versions below 6.6, the `onEnterRoom(result)` callback will be returned only for successful room entry, and the [onError()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35126#onerror) callback will be returned for room entry failure. In TRTC v6.6 and above, a positive `result` will be returned for successful room entry, and a negative `result` together with the [onError()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35126#onerror) callback will be returned for room entry failure.



### onExitRoom

Callback of room exit.
```
void onExitRoom(int reason)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| reason | int | Reason for exiting the room. 0: the user actively called `exitRoom` to exit the room; 1: the user was kicked out of the room by the server; 2: the room was dismissed. |

__Overview__

When the `exitRoom()` API in [TRTCCloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35126#trtccloud) is called, the logic related to room exit will be executed, such as releasing resources of audio/video devices and codecs. After resources are released, the SDK will use the [onExitRoom()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35126#onexitroom) callback to notify you.
If you need to call `enterRoom()` again or switch to another audio/video SDK, please wait until you receive the [onExitRoom()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35126#onexitroom) callback; otherwise, exceptions such as occupied audio device may occur.


### onSwitchRole

Callback of role switching.
```
void onSwitchRole(final int errCode, final String errMsg)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| errCode | final int | Error code. 0 indicates a successful switch. For more information, please see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35130). |
| errMsg | final String | Error message. |

__Overview__

Calling the `switchRole()` API in [TRTCCloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35126#trtccloud) will switch between the anchor and viewer roles, which will be accompanied by a line switch process. After the SDK switches the roles, the [onSwitchRole()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35126#onswitchrole) event callback will be returned.


### onConnectOtherRoom

Callback of the result of requesting cross-room call (anchor competition).
```
void onConnectOtherRoom(final String userId, final int errCode, final String errMsg)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | final String | `userId` of the target anchor to compete with |
| errCode | final int | Error code. `ERR_NULL` indicates a successful switch. For more information, please see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35130). |
| errMsg | final String | Error message. |

__Overview__

Calling the `connectOtherRoom()` API in [TRTCCloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35126#trtccloud) will establish a video call between two anchors in two different rooms, i.e., the "anchor competition" feature. The caller will receive the [onConnectOtherRoom()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35126#onconnectotherroom) callback to see whether the cross-room call is successful; and if yes, all users in both rooms will receive the [onUserVideoAvailable()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35126#onuservideoavailable) callback of anchor competition.


### onDisConnectOtherRoom

Callback of the result of ending cross-room call (anchor competition).
```
void onDisConnectOtherRoom(final int errCode, final String errMsg)
```



## Member Event Callbacks
### onRemoteUserEnterRoom

A user enters the current room.
```
void onRemoteUserEnterRoom(String userId)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | String | User ID. |

__Overview__

For the sake of performance, the behaviors of this notification will be different in two different application scenarios:
- Video call scenario (`TRTCCloudDef.TRTC_APP_SCENE_VIDEOCALL`): users in this scenario do not have different roles, and this notification will be triggered whenever a user enters the room.
- Online LVB scenario (`TRTCCloudDef.TRTC_APP_SCENE_LIVE`): this scenario does not limit the number of viewers. If any user entering or exiting the room could trigger the callback, it would cause great performance loss. Therefore, this notification will be triggered only when an anchor but not a viewer enters the room.

>Note: `onRemoteUserEnterRoom` and `onRemoteUserLeaveRoom` apply only to maintaining the "member list" of the current room. To display the remote image, it is recommended to listen on the [onUserVideoAvailable()](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35126#onuservideoavailable) event callback.



### onRemoteUserLeaveRoom

A user exits the current room.
```
void onRemoteUserLeaveRoom(String userId, int reason)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | String | User ID. |
| reason | int | Reason for exiting the room. 0: the user proactively exited the room; 1: the user exited the room due to timeout; 2: the user was kicked out of the room. |

__Overview__

Similar to `onRemoteUserEnterRoom`, the behaviors of this notification will be different in two different application scenarios:
- Video call scenario (`TRTCCloudDef.TRTC_APP_SCENE_VIDEOCALL`): users in this scenario do not have different roles, and this notification will be triggered whenever a user exits the room.
- Online LVB scenario (`TRTCCloudDef.TRTC_APP_SCENE_LIVE`): this notification will be triggered only when an anchor but not a viewer exits the room.


### onUserVideoAvailable

Whether camera is enabled for video.
```
void onUserVideoAvailable(String userId, boolean available)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | String | User ID. |
| available | boolean | Whether image is enabled. |

__Overview__

When the `onUserVideoAvailable(userId, true)` notification is received, it indicates that available video data frames of the specified image channel have arrived. In this case, the `startRemoteView(userId)` API needs to be called to load the image of the remote user. Then, the callback of rendering the first video frame, i.e., `onFirstVideoFrame(userId)`, will be received.
When the `onUserVideoAvailable(userId, false)` notification is received, it indicates that the specified channel of remote image has been disabled, which may be because the user called `muteLocalVideo()` or `stopLocalPreview()`.

### onUserSubStreamAvailable

Whether screen sharing is enabled.
```
void onUserSubStreamAvailable(String userId, boolean available)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | String | User ID. |
| available | boolean | Whether screen sharing is enabled. |

>The function to display the secondary channel image is `startRemoteSubStreamView()` instead of `startRemoteView()`.



### onUserAudioAvailable

Whether audio upstreaming is enabled.
```
void onUserAudioAvailable(String userId, boolean available)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | String | User ID. |
| available | boolean | Whether audio is enabled. |


### onFirstVideoFrame

Rendering of the first frame of a local or remote user starts.
```
void onFirstVideoFrame(String userId, int streamType, int width, int height)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | String | ID of the local or remote user. `userId == null` indicates the ID of the local user, while `userId != null` indicates the ID of a remote user. |
| streamType | int | Video stream type: camera or screen sharing. |
| width | int | Image width. |
| height | int | Image height. |

__Overview__

If `userId` is `null`, it indicates that the captured local camera image starts to be rendered, which needs to be triggered by calling `startLocalPreview` first. If `userId` is not `null`, it indicates that the first video frame of the remote user starts to be rendered, which needs to be triggered by calling `startRemoteView` first.

>This callback will be triggered only after `startLocalPreview()`, `startRemoteView()`, or `startRemoteSubStreamView()` is called.



### onFirstAudioFrame

Playback of the first audio frame of a remote user starts (local audio is not supported for notification currently).
```
void onFirstAudioFrame(String userId)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | String | Remote user ID. |


### onSendFirstLocalVideoFrame

```
void onAudioRouteChanged(int newRoute, int oldRoute)
```


### onUserVoiceVolume

Callback of volume level, including the volume level of each `userId` and total remote volume level.
```
void onUserVoiceVolume(ArrayList< TRTCCloudDef.TRTCVolumeInfo > userVolumes, int totalVolume)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userVolumes | ArrayList< TRTCCloudDef.TRTCVolumeInfo > | Volume level of all members who are speaking in the room. Value range: 0–100. |

__Overview__

The `enableAudioVolumeEvaluation` API in [TRTCCloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35126#trtccloud) can be used to enable this callback or set its triggering interval. After `enableAudioVolumeEvaluation` is called to enable the volume level callback, no matter whether there is a user speaking in the channel, the callback will be called at the set time interval. If there is no one speaking, `userVolumes` will be empty, and `totalVolume` will be `0`.

>If `userId` is `null`, it indicates the volume level of the local user. `userVolumes` only includes the volume information of users who are speaking (i.e., volume level is not 0).




## Custom Message Receipt Callbacks
### onRecvCustomCmdMsg

Callback of receipt of a custom message.
```
void onRecvCustomCmdMsg(String userId, int cmdID, int seq, byte [] message)
```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| userId | String | User ID. |
| cmdID | int | Command ID. |
| seq | int | Message number. |
| message | byte[] | Message data. |

__Overview__

When a user in a room uses `sendCustomCmdMsg` to send a custom message, other users in the room can receive the message through the `onRecvCustomCmdMsg` API.

| cmdID | int | Data stream ID. |
| errCode | int | Error code. The value is -1 in the current version. |
| missed | int | Number of lost messages. |

__Overview__

TRTC uses the UDP channel; therefore, even if reliable transmission is set, it cannot guarantee that no message will be lost; instead, it can only reduce the message loss rate to a very small value and meet general reliability requirements. After reliable transmission is set on the sender, the SDK will use this callback to notify of the number of custom messages lost during transmission in the specified past time period (usually 5s).

>Only when reliable transmission is set on the sender can the receiver receive the callback of message loss.


### onRecvSEIMsg

>- Audio data called back by this API can be modified.
>- The frame time length of audio called back by this API is always 0.02s. The formula to convert the frame time length to frame byte length is **sample rate * frame time length * number of audio channels * sampling point bit width**. For example, the default audio recording format of the SDK has a sample rate of 48,000, mono channel, and sampling point bit width of 16, so its frame byte length will be **48,000 * 0.02s * 1 * 16 bit = 15,360 bit = 1,920 bytes**.
>- The audio data called back by this API includes pre-processing effects such as background music, audio effects, and audio reverb.


### onPlayAudioFrame

```

__Parameters__

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| frame | [TRTCCloudDef.TRTCAudioFrame](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35126#trtcaudioframe) | Audio data. |

>- Do not perform any time-consuming operation in this callback function. It is recommended to directly copy the data to another thread for processing; otherwise, various audio exceptions will occur.
>- Audio data called back by this API can be modified.
>- The frame time length of audio called back by this API is always 0.02s. The formula to convert the frame time length to frame byte length is **sample rate * frame time length * number of audio channels * sampling point bit width**. For example, the default audio playback format of the SDK has a sample rate of 48,000, dual channel, and sampling point bit width of 16, so its frame byte length will be **48,000 * 0.02s * 2 * 16 bit = 30,720 bit = 3,840 bytes**.
>- The audio data called back by this API is the mix of each channel's audio playback data and does not contain the audio data from in-ear monitoring.
