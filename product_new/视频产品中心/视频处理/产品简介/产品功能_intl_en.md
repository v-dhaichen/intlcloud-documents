MPS converts audiovisual files to different bitrates and resolutions for smooth playback on various devices with different bandwidth options. It has the following features:

## Audio and Video Transcoding
Transcoding is an offline task that converts the source audiovisual bitstream. It changes parameters of the source bitstream, such as codec, resolution, and bitrate, to adapt it to different devices and network conditions. The following benefits can be achieved with transcoding:
- Increased compatibility: A source video can be transcoded to formats (e.g., MP4) that are compatible with more types of devices for smooth playback.
- Increased bandwidth adaptability: A source video can be transcoded for output in multiple definitions such as LD, SD, HD, and UHD. End users can select the most appropriate bitrate depending on their network conditions.
- Improved playback efficiency: The moov atom can be moved from the end of an MP4 file to its beginning, so the video can be played before it is entirely downloaded.
- Reduced bandwidth consumption: With a more advanced codec (e.g., H.265), the bitrate of a video can be substantially reduced while retaining the original quality, which helps reduce the bandwidth consumption.


The target specification of an output video after transcoding is subject to parameters such as codec, resolution, and bitrate, which can be customized as shown below:

## Watermarking
Watermarking is an offline task that adds an image at the specified position of the video during video transcoding or screencapturing. MPS supports the following types of watermarks:
- Static image watermark: This refers to an image watermark in PNG format. This can be a copyright owner's or TV station's logo, and is generally used to indicate the video copyright ownership.
- Animated image watermark: This refers to an image watermark in APNG format, which can be animated.

MPS can add multiple watermarks to a video or screenshot. The size and position can be customized individually.


The target specification of a watermark is subject to parameters such as type, width, height, and position which can be customized as shown below:

| Parameter                     | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Type         | Static or animated image watermark                           |
| Position     | Relative position of a watermark in the video                                 |
| ImageSize    | Size of a watermark in the video                                |
| ImageContent | Binary content of a watermark                                 |




## Screencapturing

Screencapturing is an offline task that captures a screenshot of a video at a certain point in time. MPS provides the following types of screenshots:
- Screenshot: MPS can capture screenshots of a video according to a specified set of timestamps.
- Sampled screenshot: MPS can capture a set of screenshots of a video according to a specified time interval.
- Image sprite: MPS can capture a set of screenshots of a video according to a specified time interval and stitch them together to generate a large image (i.e., image sprite).


The target specification of a screenshot is subject to parameters such as file format, width, and height, which can be customized as shown below:

### Screenshot

| FillType | Filling refers to the way of processing a screenshot when its aspect ratio is different from that of the source video. Generally, the following filling types are supported: <li>Stretch: The screenshot is stretched to match the aspect ratio of the source video, which may distort the image. </li><li>Fill in black: This option retains the aspect ratio of the source video for the screenshot and the unmatched area is filled in black. </li><li>Fill in white: This option retains the aspect ratio of the source video for the screenshot and the unmatched area is filled in white. </li><li>Gaussian blur: This option retains the aspect ratio of the source video for the screenshot and Gaussian blur is applied to the unmatched area. </li> |

>
>- The value of `Width` * `Columns` should be between 128 and 4,096 px (i.e., the range of the image sprite width).
>- The value of `Height` * `Rows` should be between 128 and 4,096 px (i.e., the range of the image sprite height).



## Animated image
Generating animated image is an offline task that converts a video to an animated image such as in GIF or WEBP format. An animated image is a seamless cycle of continuous frames, delivering an animation effect with a small file size.


The target specification of an animated image is subject to parameters such as format, width, height, and frame rate, which can be customized as shown below:

| Parameter                     | Description                                                         |
