### Billing description

+ Billing rule: Transcoding service is billed daily based on the requested codec, resolution, and output video length.
+ Billing formula: Video transcoding fees = output video length (minute) * transcoding unit price for different codec and resolution options (USD/minute)
+ Each transcoding task is billed only once. If the output video length is less than 1 minute, it will be calculated as 1 minute.

### Billing example

Suppose you utilized transcoding service in the Mumbai region on January 1 to transcode two videos with H.264 codec (the first to a 60-minute video at 2560 * 1440p resolution and the other to a 100-minute video at 1600 * 980p resolution), the transcoding fees will be generated on January 2 as calculated below:
Transcoding fees = 0.0355 (USD/minute) * 60 (minutes) + 0.023 (USD/minute) * 100 (minutes) = 4.43 USD
