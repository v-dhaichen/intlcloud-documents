## Operation Scenarios
After a domain name is added and resolved, you can access your video resources through it; however, the `Host` in a video URL obtained through the API or console remains the original domain name. Therefore, you need to log in to the console and update the `Host` information of URL in the primary distribution URL settings.
## Directions
1. Log in to the [VOD Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/overview) and click **Distribution and Playback** > **Primary Distribution URL** on the left sidebar to enter the "Primary Distribution URL" page.
2. Click **Edit** in the top-right corner and set the corresponding parameters:
 - Supported Protocol Types for Primary Distribution: HTTP and HTTPS.
 - Primary Distribution Domain Name: by default, the system-assigned `xxx.vod2.myqcloud.com` is used. You can also [add](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/14056#.E6.B7.BB.E5.8A.A0.E5.9F.9F.E5.90.8D) and [resolve](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/14056#.E8.A7.A3.E6.9E.90.E5.9F.9F.E5.90.8D) a custom domain name as the primary distribution domain name.
