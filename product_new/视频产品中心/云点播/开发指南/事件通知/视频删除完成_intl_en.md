## Event Name
FileDeleted

## Event Description
If the application is configured with event notification, after a video is deleted, the application backend can get an event notification through "normal callback" or "reliable callback". The content of the event notification is the [`FileDeleteTask` structure](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/34187#FileDeleteTask).


## Samples
### Normal Callback
If you choose the normal callback mode, the callback URL will receive an HTTP POST request from VOD, whose content is in the `BODY` as shown below (the fields with null value are omitted):

```json
{
    "EventType":"FileDeleted",
    "FileDeleteEvent":{
        "FileIdSet":[
            "24961954183381008",
            "24961954183381009",
            "24961954183381010"
        ]
    }
}
```


### Reliable Callback
If you choose the reliable callback mode, after the [PullEvents](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/34187) API is called, an HTTP response in the following format will be received (the fields with null value are omitted).

```json
{
	"Response": {
		"EventSet": [
			{
				"EventHandle": "EventHandle.N",
				"EventType": "FileDeleted",
				"FileDeleteEvent": {
                    "FileIdSet": [
                        "24961954183381008",
                        "24961954183381009",
                        "24961954183381010"
                    ]
                }
			}
		],
		"RequestId": "335bdaa3-db0e-46ce-9946-51941d9cb0f5"
	}
}
```
