## Event Name
NewFileUpload

## Event Description
If the application is configured with event notification, after a video is uploaded from a client or server, the application backend can get an event notification through "normal callback" or "reliable callback". The content of the event notification is the [`FileUploadTask` structure](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/34187#FileUploadTask).



## Normal Callback v3.0
If you choose the normal callback mode, the callback URL will receive an HTTP POST request from VOD, whose content is in the `BODY` as shown below (the fields with null value are omitted):

```json
{
    "EventType":"NewFileUpload",
    "FileUploadEvent":{
        "FileId":"5285890784273533167",
        "MediaBasicInfo":{
            "Name":"Animal World",
            "Description":"",
            "CreateTime":"2019-01-09T16:36:22Z",
            "UpdateTime":"2019-01-09T16:36:24Z",
            "ExpireTime":"9999-12-31T23:59:59Z",
            "ClassId":0,
            "ClassName":"Other",
            "ClassPath":"Other",
            "CoverUrl":"",
            "Type":"mp4",
            "MediaUrl":"http://125676836723.vod2.myqcloud.com/xxx/xxx/q1BORBPQH1IA.mp4",
            "TagSet":[

            ],
            "StorageRegion":"ap-guangzhou-2",
            "SourceInfo":{
                "SourceType":"Upload",
                "SourceContext":""
            },
            "Vid":"5285890784273533167"
        },
        "ProcedureTaskId":""
    }
}
```
## Reliable Callback v3.0
If you choose the reliable callback mode, after the [PullEvents](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/34187) API is called, an HTTP response in the following format will be received (the fields with null value are omitted).

```json
{
	"Response": {
		"EventSet": [
			{
				"EventHandle": "EventHandle.N",
				"EventType": "NewFileUpload",
				"FileUploadEvent": {
