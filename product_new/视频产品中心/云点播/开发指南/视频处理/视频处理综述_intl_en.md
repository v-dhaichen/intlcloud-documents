Video processing is a process in which a source video is analyzed or processed to generate a new video.

The above is a list of video processing features provided by VOD. In addition to a range of basic processing capabilities such as transcoding, screencapturing, and watermarking, VOD also has the following two distinctive capabilities:
- intelligent content audit, analysis, and recognition with the aid of Tencent Cloud's powerful AI.
- integration with commercial-grade DRM for high-level video encryption.

After a video processing task is initiated, the processing result cannot be output immediately (i.e., the result cannot be obtained synchronously). Therefore, video processing is performed as an offline task. For more information on how to initiate a video processing task and get the task result, please see [Video Processing Task System](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33931).
