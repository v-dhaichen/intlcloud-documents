Video content audit is an offline task that intelligently audits video content with the aid of AI. The task execution results include audit score, audit suggestion, and suspected video segments. According to the "audit suggestion", you can decide whether to allow a video to be published, effectively avoiding potential legal risks and brand image damage caused by illegal videos.

VOD can intelligently audit video image, speech recognized by ASR, and text recognized by OCR. The audit operations include detection of porn, terrorism, and politically sensitive information.

## <span id = "sh"></span>Video Content Audit Template

The audit operations in a video content audit task are subject to audit parameters, which can be presented in the form of VOD video content audit template as shown below. Such a template specifies what operations will be performed in an audit task:
- Porn information detection in video image
- Terrorism information detection in video image
- Politically sensitive information detection in video image
- ASR-based porn information detection in speech
- ASR-based politically sensitive information detection in speech
- OCR-based porn information detection in text
- OCR-based politically sensitive information detection in text

For common combinations of operations, VOD provides a [preset video content audit template](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33932#verify). <!--api In addition, you can also create and manage custom video content audit templates by calling a [server API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/34790).-->

## Task Initiation

There are three ways to initiate a video content audit task, namely, directly initiating through server API, directly initiating through the console, and specifying a task upon upload. For more information, please see [Task Initiation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33931#OriginatingTask) for video processing.

Below are instructions for initiating video content audit tasks in these ways:
<!--api
* Call the server API [ProcessMedia](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/34125) to initiate a task: specify the [video content audit template](#sh) ID in the `AiContentReviewTask` parameter in the request.
* Call the server API [ProcessMediaByUrl](#APIhttps://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33426) to initiate a task: specify the [video content audit template](#sh) ID in the `AiContentReviewTask` parameter in the request.
-->
* Initiate a task on a video through the console: [add a task flow](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/14058) in the console, enable video content audit in it, and use it to [initiate video processing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33890).
* Specify a task upon upload from server: [add a task flow](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/14058) in the console, enable video content audit in it, and specify it as the `procedure` in the [ApplyUpload](#APIhttps://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/266/31767#2.-.E8.BE.93.E5.85.A5.E5.8F.82.E6.95.B0) request.
* Specify a task upon upload from client: [add a task flow](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/14058) in the console, enable video content audit in it, and specify it as the `procedure` parameter in the [signature for upload from client](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33922#.E7.AD.BE.E5.90.8D.E5.8F.82.E6.95.B0).
* Upload through console: [add a task flow](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/14058) in the console, enable video content audit in it, upload a video through the console, select [Process Video During Upload](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33890), and specify to execute this task flow upon video upload completion.

## Getting Result

After initiating a video content audit task, you can wait for [result notification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33931#ResultNotification) asynchronously or perform [task query](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33931#TaskQuery) synchronously to get the task execution result. Below is an example of getting the result notification in normal callback mode after the content audit task is initiated (the fields with null value are omitted):

In the callback result, `ProcedureStateChangeEvent.AiContentReviewResultSet` contains three types of audit results in `Type` of `Porn`, `Terrorism`, and `Political`, which represent detection of porn, terrorism, and politically sensitive information in video image, respectively.

* The result in `Type` of `Porn` shows that `Output.Suggestion` is `block`, that is, the possibility of porn information presence is high and blocking is recommended, the confidence of porn information is 98, and the reason is `sexy` (sexiness).
* The result `Output.SegmentSet` in `Type` of `Porn` lists three video segments suspected of containing porn information. The start time and end time of each segment are marked by `StartTimeOffset` and `EndTimeOffset`.
* The result in `Type` of `Terrorism` and `Political` shows that the video is not suspected of containing terrorism and politically sensitive information.
