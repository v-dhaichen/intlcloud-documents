VOD provides an SDK for Java for uploading videos from a server. For more information on the upload process, please see [Upload Videos from Server](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33912).

## Integration Steps

### Importing Maven dependency

</dependency>
```

### Importing jar packages

If Maven is not used for dependency management in your project, you can directly download the required jar packages and import them into the project:

Download the jar packages associated with the SDK for Java [here](https://github.com/tencentyun/vod-java-sdk/raw/master/packages/vod-sdk-jar.zip) and import them into your project.



## Simple Upload
### Initializing upload client object
Initialize a `VodUploadClient` instance with a TencentCloud API key.
```
VodUploadClient client = new VodUploadClient("your secretId", "your secretKey");
```

### Constructing upload request object
Set the local media upload path.
```
VodUploadRequest request = new VodUploadRequest();
request.setMediaFilePath("/data/videos/Wildlife.wmv");
```

### Calling upload
Call the upload method and pass in the access point region and upload request.
```
try {
    VodUploadResponse response = client.upload("ap-guangzhou", request);
    logger.info("Upload FileId = {}", response.getFileId());
} catch (Exception e) {
    // The business team performs troubleshooting
    logger.error("Upload Err", e);
}
```

>The upload method automatically selects simple upload or multipart upload based on the file size, eliminating your need to take care of every step in multipart upload.

## Advanced Features
### Uploading a cover
```
VodUploadClient client = new VodUploadClient("your secretId", "your secretKey");
VodUploadRequest request = new VodUploadRequest();
request.setMediaFilePath("/data/videos/Wildlife.wmv");
request.setCoverFilePath("/data/videos/Wildlife.jpg");
try {
    VodUploadResponse response = client.upload("ap-guangzhou", request);
    logger.info("Upload FileId = {}", response.getFileId());
} catch (Exception e) {
    // The business team performs troubleshooting
    logger.error("Upload Err", e);
}
```

### Specifying a task flow
First, [create a task flow template](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/14058) and name it. When initiating the task flow, you can set the `Procedure` parameter with the task flow template name, and the task flow will be executed automatically upon upload success.
```
VodUploadClient client = new VodUploadClient("your secretId", "your secretKey");
VodUploadRequest request = new VodUploadRequest();
request.setMediaFilePath("/data/videos/Wildlife.wmv");
request.setProcedure("Your Procedure Name");
try {
    VodUploadResponse response = client.upload("ap-guangzhou", request);
    logger.info("Upload FileId = {}", response.getFileId());
} catch (Exception e) {
    // The business team performs troubleshooting
    logger.error("Upload Err", e);
}
```

### Uploading to a subapplication
Pass in a [subapplication](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33987) ID. After the upload is successful, the resource will belong only to the specified subapplication.
```
VodUploadClient client = new VodUploadClient("your secretId", "your secretKey");
VodUploadRequest request = new VodUploadRequest();
request.setMediaFilePath("/data/videos/Wildlife.wmv");
request.setSubAppId(101);
try {
    VodUploadResponse response = client.upload("ap-guangzhou", request);
    logger.info("Upload FileId = {}", response.getFileId());
} catch (Exception e) {
    // The business team performs troubleshooting
    logger.error("Upload Err", e);
}
```

### Specifying a storage region
In the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod), confirm that the target storage region has been activated. If not, you can do so as instructed in [Upload Storage Settings](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/18874) and then set the [abbreviation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33910) of the storage region through the `StorageRegion` attribute.
```
VodUploadClient client = new VodUploadClient("your secretId", "your secretKey");
VodUploadRequest request = new VodUploadRequest();
request.setMediaFilePath("/data/videos/Wildlife.wmv");
request.setStorageRegion("ap-chongqing");
try {
    VodUploadResponse response = client.upload("ap-guangzhou", request);
    logger.info("Upload FileId = {}", response.getFileId());
} catch (Exception e) {
    // The business team performs troubleshooting
    logger.error("Upload Err", e);
}
```

### Specifying the number of concurrent parts
The number of concurrent parts is applicable to uploading a large file in multiple parts simultaneously. The advantage of multipart upload lies in that a large file can be uploaded quickly. The SDK automatically selects simple upload or multipart upload based on the file size, eliminating your need to take care of every step in multipart upload. The number of concurrent parts of the file is specified by the `ConcurrentUploadNumber` parameter.
```
VodUploadClient client = new VodUploadClient("your secretId", "your secretKey");
VodUploadRequest request = new VodUploadRequest();
request.setMediaFilePath("/data/videos/Wildlife.wmv");
request.setConcurrentUploadNumber(5);
try {
    VodUploadResponse response = client.upload("ap-guangzhou", request);
    logger.info("Upload FileId = {}", response.getFileId());
} catch (Exception e) {
    // The business team performs troubleshooting
    logger.error("Upload Err", e);
}
```
