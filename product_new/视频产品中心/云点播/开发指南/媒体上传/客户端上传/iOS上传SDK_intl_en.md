VOD provides an Upload SDK for iOS for uploading videos on the iOS platform. For more information on the upload process, please see [Uploading Videos from Client](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33921).

## Downloading Source Code
1. Click [here](http://ugcupload-1252463788.file.myqcloud.com/TXUGCUploadDemo_iOS.zip) to download the iOS Upload Demo and source code.
2. You can see the `TXUGCUploadDemo` directory after decompressing the downloaded zip package. The upload source code is in the `TXUGCUploadDemo/upload` directory.

## Integrating Upload Library and Source Code

1. Copy the upload source code directory `TXUGCUploadDemo/upload` to your project directory.
2. Import the dynamic libraries `QCloudCore.framework` and `QCloudCOSXML.framework` and the static library `libmtasdk.a` (in the `TXUGCUploadDemo/upload/COSSDK/` directory) into your project and add the following dependency libraries:
    ```
    1. CoreTelephony.framework
    2. Foundation.framework
    3. SystemConfiguration.framework
    4. libc++.tbd
    ``` 
3. Set "Other Linker Flags" in "Build Settings" and add the `-ObjC` parameter.

## Simple Video Upload

#### Initializing an upload object

```objc
TXUGCPublish *_videoPublish = [[TXUGCPublish alloc] initWithUserID:@"upload_video_userid"];
```

#### Setting upload object callback

```objc
_videoPublish.delegate = self;
```

```objc
#pragma mark - TXVideoPublishListener

- (void)onPublishProgress:(NSInteger)uploadBytes totalBytes:(NSInteger)totalBytes {
    self.progressView.progress = (float)uploadBytes/totalBytes;
    NSLog(@"onPublishProgress [%ld/%ld]", uploadBytes, totalBytes);
}

- (void)onPublishComplete:(TXPublishResult*)result {
    NSString *string = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Upload completed; error code: [%d], error message: [%@]", result.retCode, result.retCode == 0? result.videoURL: result.descMsg];
    [self showErrorMessage:string];
    NSLog(@"onPublishComplete [%d/%@]", result.retCode, result.retCode == 0? result.videoURL: result.descMsg);
}
```

#### Constructing upload parameter

```objc
TXPublishParam *publishParam = [[TXPublishParam alloc] init];

publishParam.signature  = @"Signature generated by your business backend";
publishParam.videoPath  = @"Path to the video file";
```
For the rule of signature calculation, please see [Signature for Upload from Client](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33922).

#### Calling upload

```objc
[_videoPublish publishVideo:publishParam];
```
>The upload method automatically selects simple upload or multipart upload based on the file size, eliminating your need to take care of every step in multipart upload.

## Advanced Features
#### Uploading a cover

Include the cover image in the upload parameter.

```objc
TXPublishParam *publishParam = [[TXPublishParam alloc] init];
publishParam.signature  = @"Signature generated by your business backend";
publishParam.coverPath = @"Path to the cover image file";
publishParam.videoPath  = @"Path to the video file";
```

#### Canceling and resuming upload

To cancel an upload, call the `canclePublish` API.

```objc
[_videoPublish canclePublish];
```

To resume an upload, call `publishVideo` of `TXUGCPublish` again by using the same upload parameter, with the paths to the video and cover unchanged.

#### Resumable upload

During the video upload process, VOD supports resumable upload, that is, when the upload is terminated unexpectedly, you can upload the file again from where it left off, which helps reduce the upload time.

The effective time for resumption is 1 day, i.e., if the upload of a video is interrupted and then resumed within 1 day, it can be directly resumed; otherwise, the full video will be uploaded again by default.

`enableResume` in the upload parameter is the switch for resumable upload, which is enabled by default.


## Image and Media Upload

```objc
// Create object
TXUGCPublish *_imagePublish = [[TXUGCPublish alloc] initWithUserID:@"upload_image_userid"];

// Set callback
_imagePublish.mediaDelegate = self;

// Construct upload parameter
TXMediaPublishParam *publishParam = [[TXMediaPublishParam alloc] init];
publishParam.signature  = @"Signature generated by your business backend";
publishParam.mediaPath = @"Path to the image file";

// Upload image or media file
[_imagePublish publishMedia:publishParam];

```
