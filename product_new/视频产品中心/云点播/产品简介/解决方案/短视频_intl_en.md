According to the characteristics of UGSV applications, VOD provides a solution suitable for this type of application scenarios to help you quickly and efficiently conduct UGSV business.

## Video Production

During video production in a UGSV application, common features include shooting, cropping, audio mixing, special effect processing, subtitling, and sticker adding.

VOD provides a [UGSV SDK](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/584/9366) to help you quickly integrate a rich set of video production capabilities into your client.

The [UGSV SDK](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/584/9366) integrates the feature of video upload from client, so you are recommended to use it for uploading videos from client. If you do not want to use it, you can use the [upload from client SDK](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33921) provided separately.

VOD provides a [malicious video hosting prevention](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33906#malicious-video-hosting-prevention) scheme. It helps prevent your resources from being misused for malicious video hosting by restricting the number of times a URL can be obtained and played back.
