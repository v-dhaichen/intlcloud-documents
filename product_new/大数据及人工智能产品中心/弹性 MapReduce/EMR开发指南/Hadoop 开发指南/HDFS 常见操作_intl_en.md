Elastic MapReduce (EMR) Hadoop service is integrated with the COS service. When you purchase a EMR cluster, if you select COS  and make it available for your cluster, you can manipulate the data stored in COS using common Hadoop commands as shown below:

``` shell
# cat data
hadoop fs -cat /usr/hive/warehouse/hivewithhdfs.db/record/data.txt
# Modify directory or file permission
hadoop fs -chmod -R 777 /usr
# Change file or directory owner
hadoop fs -chown -R root:root /usr
# Create a folder
hadoop fs -mkdir <paths>
# Send a local file to HDFS
hadoop fs -put <localsrc> ... <dst>
# Copy a local file to HDFS
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal <localsrc> URI
# View the storage usage of a file or directory
hadoop fs -du URI [URI …]
# Delete a file
hadoop fs -rm URI [URI …]
# Set the number of copies of a directory or file
hadoop fs–setrep [-R] [-w] REP PATH [PATH …]
# Check for bad blocks of a cluster file
hadoop fsck <path> [-move | -delete | -openforwrite] [-files [-blocks [-locations | -racks]]]
```

For more HDFS commands, see the [community documentation](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.3/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HDFSCommands.html). If your cluster is a high-availability cluster (dual-namenode), you can see which namenode is active by running following command:

``` shell
# nn1 is the ID of namenode, which is generally nn1 and nn2
hdfs haadmin -getServiceState nn1
# View current cluster report
hdfs dfsadmin -report
# namenode exited safe mode
hdfs dfsadmin -safemode leave
```
