2. On the cluster overview page, you can find the cluster status, component status, hardware status, resource status, and monitoring metrics.
 - Use the "project drop-down list" to filter the clusters by project.
 - Use the "region drop-down list" to filter the clusters by region.
 - Use the "cluster name drop-down list" to select the name of the cluster for overview.
