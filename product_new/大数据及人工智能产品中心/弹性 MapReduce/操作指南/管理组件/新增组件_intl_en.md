## Scenario
This document describes how to add a component that is not installed in the cluster in the EMR Console.
>Please manage the components through **Component Management**. Component changes made directly to a server (such as adding a component) will not be synced back to the console and thus cannot be further managed.

## Directions
1. Log in to the EMR Console and select **Component Management** in the left sidebar.
2. On the component management page, click **Add Component** to add a component that is not installed in the cluster.
