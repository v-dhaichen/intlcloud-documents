## Application Scenario
EMR supports component configuration modification in the console, as shown below.

## Operation Guide
1. Log in to the EMR Console, select **Parameter Configuration** > **Modify Parameters** in the left sidebar, select the project, region, and configuration file, and click **Next**.
2. Enter the parameter modification page, then you can add, edit, or delete parameters. For parameters without specified values, the default values will be assigned.
3. After the editing is completed, click **Next** to enter the task verification page, where you can add a note to the modifications and double check the parameters that will be changed. After confirming everything is correct, click **Submit and Distribute Configuration**.
Please wait for the parameter modification task to be submitted. You can choose to restart the component immediately or restart at a scheduled time that works the best.
>If you are using EMR Console to modify component parameters which have been updated using Shell command lines, the latest modification will overwrite the previous one.
