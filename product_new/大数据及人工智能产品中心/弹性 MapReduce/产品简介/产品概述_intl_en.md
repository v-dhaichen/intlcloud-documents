Tencent Cloud Elastic MapReduce (EMR) is a cloud-hosted Hadoop service that features Hadoop cluster deployment, software installation, configuration modification, monitoring and alarming, and elastic scaling, providing individual and enterprise users with a secure and stable big data processing solution.

## Features

- With open-source Hadoop, you can use Tencent Cloud EMR to move vast amounts of data form your local data center to the Cloud. Tencent Cloud Elastic MapReduce (EMR) is integrated with popular components (e.g., Hive, Hbase, Spark, Presto, Sqoop, and Hue) to simplify data processing and management, such as offline big data processing and stream computing.

- EMR seamlessly incorporates the Tencent Cloud Cloud Object Storage (COS) service, allowing you to migrate files stored in HDFS to COS with unlimited scalability, low storage costs and high reliability for separation of computation and storage. With COS, a cluster can be created whenever needed and terminated after the task is completed without the concerns over data loss. In addition, the on-demand clusters can significantly reduce your big data processing costs.

- EMR has five node types: master, core, task, router, and common nodes. For the purposes of each type, see [Node Type Descriptions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1026/31094).

- Currently, EMR supports a wide variety of resource specifications, including Standard, MEM-optimized, High IO, Compute, and Big Data models. If you need to deploy a Hadoop cluster on a CPM instance, contact us by [submitting a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
