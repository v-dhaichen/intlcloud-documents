## 1. Service Address

The API supports access from either a nearby region (at cvm.tencentcloudapi.com) or a specified region (at cvm.ap-guangzhou.tencentcloudapi.com for Guangzhou, for example).

It is recommended to use the domain name for accessing the nearest server. When you call an API, this domain name is automatically resolved to a server in the region **nearest** to the client where the API is initiated. For example, when you initiate an API request in Guangzhou, this domain name is automatically resolved to a Guangzhou server, the result is the same as that of specifying the region in the domain like "cvm.ap-guangzhou.tencentcloudapi.com".

**Note: For latency-sensitive businesses, it is recommended to specify a domain name with region.**

Below lists the currently supported regions:

| Access region | Domain name |
|----------|------|
| Nearest region (recommended, and is only for non-Finance regions) | cvm.tencentcloudapi.com |
| South China (Guangzhou) | cvm.ap-guangzhou.tencentcloudapi.com|
| East China (Shanghai) | cvm.ap-shanghai.tencentcloudapi.com |
| North China (Beijing) | cvm.ap-beijing.tencentcloudapi.com |
| Southwest China (Chengdu) | cvm.ap-chengdu.tencentcloudapi.com |
| Southwest China (Chongqing) | cvm.ap-chongqing.tencentcloudapi.com |
| Southeast Asia (Hong Kong) | cvm.ap-hongkong.tencentcloudapi.com |
| Southeast Asia (Singapore) | cvm.ap-singapore.tencentcloudapi.com |

**Note: As [financial availability zones](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/304/2766) and non-financial availability zones are isolated, when accessing the services in a financial availability zone (with the common parameter Region specifying a financial availability zone), it is necessary to specify a domain name with the financial availability zone, preferably in the same region as specified in Region.**

| Finance Region | Domain Name |
|----------|------|
| East China (Shanghai Finance) | cvm.ap-shanghai-fsi.tencentcloudapi.com |
| South China (Shenzhen Finance) | cvm.ap-shenzhen-fsi.tencentcloudapi.com |
