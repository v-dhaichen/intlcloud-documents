## Response for Successful Requests
 
For example, when calling CVM API (version: 2017-03-12) to view the status of instances (DescribeInstancesStatus), if the request has succeeded, you may see the response as shown below:

    {
        "Response": {
            "TotalCount": 0,
            "InstanceStatusSet": [],
            "RequestId": "b5b41468-520d-4192-b42f-595cc34b6c1c"
        }
    }

* The API will return `Response`, which contains `RequestId`, as long as it processes the request. It does not matter if the request is successful or not. 
* RequestId is the unique ID of an API request. Contact us with this ID when an exception occurs.
* Except for the fixed fields, all fields are action-specified. For the definitions of action-specified fields, see the corresponding API documentation. In this example, `TotalCount` and `InstanceStatusSet `are the fields specified by the API `DescribeInstancesStatus`. 0 `TotalCount` means that the requester owns 0 CVM instance so the `InstanceStatusSet` is empty.

## Response for Failed Requests

If the call has failed, you may see the response as shown below:

    {
        "Response": {
            "Error": {
                "Code": "AuthFailure.SignatureFailure",
                "Message": "The provided credentials could not be validated. Please ensure your signature is correct."
            },
            "RequestId": "ed93f3cb-f35e-473f-b9f3-0d451b8b79c6"
        }
    }

* The presence of the `Error` field indicates that the request has failed. A response for failed request must include `Error`, along with `Code` and `Message`.
* `Code` is the code of the error that helps you identify the cause and solution. There are two types of error codes so you may find the code in either common error codes or API-specified error codes.
* `Message` describes the cause of this error and it may change as Tencent Cloud services update.
* RequestId is the unique ID of an API request. Contact us with this ID when an exception occurs.


## Common Error Codes


If there is an Error field in the response, it means that the API call failed. The Code field in Error indicates the error code. The following table lists the common error codes that all actions can return.
