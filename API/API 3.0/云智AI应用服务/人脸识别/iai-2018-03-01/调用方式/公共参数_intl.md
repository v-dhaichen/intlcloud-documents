The common parameters are used to authenticate the user and API. If not necessary, these parameters are not described in individual API documents. However, they have to be carried by each request to initiate properly.

## Signature Method v3

When the TC3-HMAC-SHA256 signature method is used, the common parameters should be uniformly placed in the HTTP request header as shown below:

| Parameter name | Type | Required | Description |
|--------|----|----|----|
| X-TC-Action | String | Yes | API name of the action. For the value range, see the description of the common input parameter "Action" in the API documentation. For example, the value of the CVM instance list querying API is DescribeInstances. |
| X-TC-Region | String | Yes | The Region parameter used to identify the region whose data you want to operate on. For the value range of the regions acceptable to the API, see the description of the common input parameter "Region" in the API documentation. Note: This parameter does not need to be passed in for some APIs, which are specifically described in the API documentation. In this case, even if passed in, it will not take effect. |
| X-TC-Timestamp | Integer | Yes | The current UNIX timestamp which records when an API request is initiated. For example, 1529223702. Note: If it is more than 5 minutes different from the current time on the API server, it will cause a signature expiry error. |
| X-TC-Version | String | Yes | API version of the action. For the value range, see the description of the common input parameter "Version" in the API documentation. For example, the version of CVM is 2017-03-12. |
| Authorization | String | Yes | Header field of the standard authentication of the HTTP request, for example: <br/>TC3-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=AKIDEXAMPLE/Date/service/tc3_request, SignedHeaders=content-type;host, Signature=fe5f80f77d5fa3beca038a248ff027d0445342fe2855ddc963176630326f1024 <br/>Here, <br/>- TC3-HMAC-SHA256: Signature method, currently fixed as this value; <br/>- Credential: Signature credential; AKIDEXAMPLE is the SecretId; Date is a date in UTC time, whose value should match the UTC date converted by the common parameter X-TC-Timestamp; service is the product name, which should match the domain name of the product called, such as cvm; <br/>- SignedHeaders: Information of the headers involving in the signature; content-type and host are required headers; <br/>- Signature: Signature summary. |
| X-TC-Token | String | No | The token used by the temporary certificate, which needs to be used in conjunction with the temporary key. The temporary key and token need to be obtained through the access management service call API. Long-term keys do not require a token. |

Assuming you want to query the list of Cloud Virtual Machine instances in the Guangzhou region, the request structure in the form of request URL, request header and request body may be as follows:

Example of an HTTP GET request structure:

```
https://cvm.tencentcloudapi.com/?Limit=10&Offset=0

Authorization: TC3-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=AKIDz8krbsJ5yKBZQpn74WFkmLPx3EXAMPLE/2018-10-09/cvm/tc3_request, SignedHeaders=content-type;host, Signature=5da7a33f6993f0614b047e5df4582db9e9bf4672ba50567dba16c6ccf174c474

X-TC-Action: DescribeInstances
X-TC-Version: 2017-03-12
X-TC-Timestamp: 1539084154
X-TC-Region: ap-guangzhou
```

Example of an HTTP POST (application/json) request structure:

```
https://cvm.tencentcloudapi.com/

Authorization: TC3-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=AKIDEXAMPLE/2018-05-30/cvm/tc3_request, SignedHeaders=content-type;host, Signature=582c400e06b5924a6f2b5d7d672d79c15b13162d9279b0855cfba6789a8edb4c

{"Offset":0,"Limit":10}
```

Example of an HTTP POST (multipart/form-data) request structure (only supported by specific APIs):

```

## Signature Method v1

When the HmacSHA1 or HmacSHA256 signature method is used, the common parameters should be uniformly placed in request string as shown below:

| Parameter name | Type | Required | Description |
|:---------|:---------|:-----|:---- |
| Action | String | Yes | API name of the action. For the value range, see the description of the common input parameter "Action" in the API documentation. For example, the value of the CVM instance list querying API is DescribeInstances. |
| Region | String | Yes | The Region parameter used to identify the region whose data you want to operate on. For the value range of the regions acceptable to the API, see the description of the common input parameter "Region" in the API documentation. Note: This parameter does not need to be passed in for some APIs, which are specifically described in the API documentation. In this case, even if passed in, it will not take effect. |
| Timestamp | Integer | Yes | The current UNIX timestamp which records when an API request is initiated. For example, 1529223702. If it is too different from the current time, it will cause a signature expiry error. |
| Nonce | Integer | Yes | A random positive integer used to prevent replay attacks along with Timestamp. |
| SecretId | String | Yes | The identifying SecretId obtained on the [TencentCloud API Key](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/capi) page. A SecretId corresponds to a unique SecretKey which is used to generate the request signature (Signature). |
| Signature | String | Yes | Request signature used to verify the validity of this request. This is calculated based on the actual input parameters. For details on how to calculate, see the API authentication document. |
| Version | String | Yes | API version of the action. For the value range, see the description of the common input parameter "Version" in the API documentation. For example, the version of CVM is 2017-03-12. |
| SignatureMethod | String | No | Signature method. Currently, only HmacSHA256 and HmacSHA1 are supported. The HmacSHA256 algorithm is used to verify the signature only when this parameter is specified as HmacSHA256. In other cases, the signature is verified with HmacSHA1. |
| Token | String | No | The token used by the temporary certificate, which needs to be used in conjunction with the temporary key. The temporary key and token need to be obtained through the access management service call API. Long-term keys do not require a token. |
