## 1. API Description

API request domain name: batch.tencentcloudapi.com.

This API is used to terminate a task instance
For task instances with state SUCCEED or FAILED, Batch doesn't process them.
For task instances with state SUBMITTED, PENDING or RUNNABLE, Batch sets them to the FAILED state.
For task instances with state STARTING, RUNNING or FAILED_INTERRUPTED, Batch terminates the CVM first and then sets them to the FAILED state, which is time-consuming. In particular, if the CVM is being created and thus cannot be terminated immediately, Batch will register a scheduled termination operation in the bypass and asynchronously terminate the CVM after it is created.
For task instances with state FAILED_INTERRUPTED, the related resources and quotas will be released only after the TerminateTaskInstance operation actually succeeds.
This API only supports jobs submitted to an anonymous compute environment (where ComputeEnv but not EnvId is specified for SubmitJob). For jobs submitted to a named compute environment (where EnvId but not ComputeEnv is specified for SubmitJob), the TerminateTaskInstance and TerminateJob operations are not supported.

Default API request frequency limit: 2 times/second.
