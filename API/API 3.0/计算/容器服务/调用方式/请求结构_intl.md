## 1. Service Address

In this product, your API requests are routed to the nearest server via the domain name cvm.tencentcloudapi.com. You can also access APIs using the domain name for specified region, such as cvm.ap-guangzhou.tencentcloudapi.com for Guangzhou region.

It is recommended to use the domain name for accessing the nearest server. When you call an API, this domain name is automatically resolved to a server in a region **nearest** to the client where the API is initiated. For example, when you initiate an API request in Guangzhou, this domain name is automatically resolved to a Guangzhou server, with the result same as that of using "cvm.ap-guangzhou.tencentcloudapi.com".

**Note: For business sensitive to latency, it is recommended to specify domain names containing the region.**

The supported domain names are listed as below:

| Region | Domain Name |
