Welcome to Tencent Cloud Auto Scaling (AS)!
Auto Scaling (AS) can automatically adjust computing resources according to users' business needs and policies. AS can properly increase or decrease CVM instances and complete the configuration based on the scheduled, periodic or monitoring policies specified by users. It can automatically increase CVM instances to ensure smooth and healthy business operations when business demands are soaring, and reduce CVM instances to save resources and costs when business demands are decreasing.
