## API Responses for Successful Calls

Example: this example describes the status of the specified instance (DescribeInstancesStatus) with version 2017-03-12. Below is a sample respond indicating the success of an API call.
    {
        "Response": {
            "TotalCount": 0,
            "InstanceStatusSet": [],
            "RequestId": "b5b41468-520d-4192-b42f-595cc34b6c1c"
        }
    }

* The API tells clients whether the request worked as expected by sending a response contains a RequestId parameter.
* RequestId is the ID of an API request. The RequestId is required to troubleshoot issues.
* Except for the fixed fields, all the fields are defined by the specific API. For the fields returned by different APIs, see the definitions in the API documentation. In this example, TotalCount and InstanceStatusSet are the fields defined by the DescribeInstancesStatus API. As the user who calls the request does not have a Cloud Virtual Machine instance yet, TotalCount returns a value of 0 in this case and the InstanceStatusSet list is empty.

##  API Responses for Errors

If the call fails, the response may look like the example below:
    {
        "Response": {
            "Error": {
                "Code": "AuthFailure.SignatureFailure",
                "Message": "The provided credentials could not be validated. Please ensure your signature is correct."
            },
            "RequestId": "ed93f3cb-f35e-473f-b9f3-0d451b8b79c6"
        }
    }

* Errors indicates that the call may failed.
The API returns Error, which contains Code and Message, when the request went wrong.
* Code is the unique error response code, which is returned when an API request fails and indicates the details of the error, and helps identify why the errors occur and how to solve them.
* Message explains the cause of the error. Note that the returned messages are subject to change. The information the messages provided may not be up-to-date. So please not use it as your only and primary reference.
* RequestId is the ID of an API request. The RequestId is required to troubleshoot issues.
