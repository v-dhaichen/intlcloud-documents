## Feature Description

When an API call fails, an *Error* is returned in the result. For example:

```
 {
    "Response": {
        "Error": {
            "Code": "AuthFailure.SignatureFailure",
            "Message": "The provided credentials could not be validated. Please check your signature is correct."
        },
        "RequestId": "ed93f3cb-f35e-473f-b9f3-0d451b8b79c6"
    }
}
```

In *Error*, *Code* indicates the error code, and *Message* specifies the detailed information of that error.
